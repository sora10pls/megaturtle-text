sp_monbo_home_0001_001	Hello there! My name is Poké Boy! It's my job to help you figure out your way around Pokémon HOME!
sp_monbo_home_0001_002	Whenever you head to a new screen for the first time, your trusty pal Poké Boy will tell you all about it! What do you say we learn about this screen?
sp_monbo_home_0002_001	Well, golly! This is your room! You can view your favorite Pokémon here!
sp_monbo_home_0002_002	What's more, you can even check your Profile and how many Pokémon HOME Points you've got! Neat-o!
sp_monbo_home_0002_003	By tapping the displayed icons, you can jump to a whole bunch of different screens! Well, hey, why not try it out?
sp_monbo_binder_0001_001	Catch Pokémon and complete Challenges to get some real nifty stickers!
sp_monbo_binder_0001_002	You can place your stickers here and show them off! Be proud of your completed Challenges and your stickers!
sp_monbo_binder_0001_003	OH! I almost forgot! You can place and remove stickers as many times as you like. So don't worry about losing them!
sp_monbo_bank_0001_001	On this screen, you can easily view a lineup of all the Pokémon you've sent to Pokémon HOME!
sp_monbo_bank_0001_002	Tap on a Pokémon, and you'll be able to see all kinds of different nifty information about it! Wow!
sp_monbo_bank_0001_003	By the way, you can set different search settings to filter and find Pokémon faster. You should give it a try sometime!
sp_monbo_label_0001_001	When you want to group a bunch of different Pokémon together, labels are the best thing for it!
sp_monbo_label_0001_002	You can create a label for Pokémon you've raised for battle, a label for rare Pokémon... Golly! You can create a label for just about anything you like!
sp_monbo_label_0001_003	You can check and make labels on this screen and on the screen where you check a Pokémon's detailed info. Don't be shy! Try making some labels anytime you like!
sp_monbo_gts_0001_001	Wowzers! This is the GTS! You can trade Pokémon with other players all over the world from here!
sp_monbo_gts_0001_002	Choose a Pokémon you want to trade and a Pokémon you want to receive in return. Then all you gotta do is wait! Someone else should come along and trade you the Pokémon you want!
sp_monbo_gts_0001_003	You can also go have a look at the Pokémon other Trainers want to trade for. Then you can trade them that Pokémon for the one they offered! Golly, that's great!
sp_monbo_group_trade_0001_001	When you want to trade Pokémon with specific players, you've absolutely got to use a Room Trade!
sp_monbo_group_trade_0001_002	You can either create a trade room and look for folks to join, or jump into another player's trade room. Either works just fine!
sp_monbo_group_trade_0001_003	Your chosen Pokémon will be traded randomly for the Pokémon of another player in the trade room!
sp_monbo_miracle_box_0001_001	If you want to try a different kind of fun and exciting Pokémon trade, then you should try using the Wonder Box! Oh boy!
sp_monbo_miracle_box_0001_002	Choose a Pokémon you want to trade, and put it in your Wonder Box!
sp_monbo_miracle_box_0001_003	After a bit of time—you never know just when—your Pokémon will be traded for another player's Pokémon from their own Wonder Box. Golly, how neat-o! The power of science is amazing!
sp_monbo_miracle_box_success_0001_001	Wowee! You've traded your first Pokémon through the Wonder Box!
sp_monbo_miracle_box_success_0001_002	To commemorate your Wonder Box trade, I've got a special Pokémon gift for you!
sp_monbo_miracle_box_success_0001_003	Make sure to go get it from the gift box for Mystery Gifts! OK?
sp_monbo_trade_top_0001_001	You can trade Pokémon in all KINDS of ways in Pokémon HOME!
sp_monbo_trade_top_0001_002	Deposit your Pokémon in the Wonder Box and give the OK to send it out to be traded! Boy, it sure is fun waiting for a Pokémon to be traded with someone else's from anywhere in the world!
sp_monbo_trade_top_0001_003	The GTS should be your choice if you want to trade for a specific Pokémon with other users around the world!
sp_monbo_trade_top_0001_004	I'd suggest creating a Room Trade when you'd like to trade Pokémon with a group of users that you know!
sp_monbo_trade_top_0001_005	Oh yeah! Friend Trades are handy for when you'd like to trade with Trainers you know who are on your Friend List. You should try them out sometime!
sp_monbo_battle_data_0001_001	Battle Data is where you can check out all sorts of info about Pokémon battles!
sp_monbo_battle_data_0001_002	You can check the rankings of Trainers around the world. You can even check your own Battle Records if you've linked your Nintendo Account. Isn't that cool?
sp_monbo_gift_0001_001	You've been given a present to commemorate the new update for Pokémon HOME!
sp_monbo_gift_0001_002	You can pick it up from the Mystery Gifts menu!
sp_monbo_gift_0001_003	There's a present for you to commemorate the games being linked!
sp_monbo_gift_0002_001	Choose the Pokémon you want!
sp_monbo_gift_0002_002	Are you sure you want the [VAR_PKCATEGORY] [VAR_PKNAME]?
sp_monbo_get_calendar_0001_001	This is the Catch Calendar! All the Pokémon you have in Pokémon HOME can be found here, arranged in order based on the date on which you caught them!
sp_monbo_get_calendar_0001_002	You can set any day you want as an Anniversary as well as change these settings later on, if you'd like. You can see which Pokémon were caught on Anniversaries, too.
sp_monbo_get_calendar_0001_003	Go ahead and set up days that are important to you as Anniversaries!
sp_monbo_software_library_0001_001	These are the Pokédexes of the different games! Here, you can check out the Pokédexes of all the different games that can link to Pokémon HOME, including the main Pokémon series! Isn't that cool?
sp_monbo_software_library_0001_002	If you want to register a Pokémon to one of the Pokédexes here, just catch that Pokémon in the game with the dex you're interested in, and move it to Pokémon HOME!
sp_monbo_software_library_0001_003	A Pokémon won't be registered to a game's Pokédex unless they're caught in that game, so just watch out for that!
sp_monbo_software_library_0001_004	I hope you catch and trade a ton of Pokémon so that you can complete every game's Pokédex!

sp_oak_00001	Excellent! Access successful!
sp_oak_00002	Now, can you see me? ...Ah, it seems this is working!
sp_oak_00003	My name is Grand Oak. I'm a renowned Pokémon researcher! It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
sp_oak_00004	I'm the one who developed Pokémon HOME, which— as I'm sure you're aware—you're accessing right now. What a grand day to remember!

ZKN_ALPHA_000_000	
ZKN_ALPHA_001_000	Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight. There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger.
ZKN_ALPHA_002_000	There is a bud on this Pokémon's back. To support its weight, Ivysaur's legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight, it's a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.
ZKN_ALPHA_003_000	There is a large flower on Venusaur's back. The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people.
ZKN_ALPHA_004_000	The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is enjoying itself. If the Pokémon becomes enraged, the flame burns fiercely.
ZKN_ALPHA_005_000	Charmeleon mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp claws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive. In this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with a bluish white color.
ZKN_ALPHA_006_000	Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.
ZKN_ALPHA_007_000	Squirtle's shell is not merely used for protection. The shell's rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minimize resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.
ZKN_ALPHA_008_000	Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail becomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon's toughness as a battler.
ZKN_ALPHA_009_000	Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very accurate. They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet.
ZKN_ALPHA_010_000	Caterpie has a voracious appetite. It can devour leaves bigger than its body right before your eyes. From its antenna, this Pokémon releases a terrifically strong odor.
ZKN_ALPHA_011_000	The shell covering this Pokémon's body is as hard as an iron slab. Metapod does not move very much. It stays still because it is preparing its soft innards for evolution inside the hard shell.
ZKN_ALPHA_012_000	Butterfree has a superior ability to search for delicious honey from flowers. It can even search out, extract, and carry honey from flowers that are blooming over six miles from its nest.
ZKN_ALPHA_013_000	Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable of distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose).
ZKN_ALPHA_014_000	Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares for its coming evolution. This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch.
ZKN_ALPHA_015_000	Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach its nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack in a furious swarm.
ZKN_ALPHA_016_000	Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It is capable of unerringly returning home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings.
ZKN_ALPHA_017_000	Pidgeotto claims a large area as its own territory. This Pokémon flies around, patrolling its living space. If its territory is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws.
ZKN_ALPHA_018_000	This Pokémon has a dazzling plumage of beautifully glossy feathers. Many Trainers are captivated by the striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling them to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon.
ZKN_ALPHA_019_000	Rattata is cautious in the extreme. Even while it is asleep, it constantly listens by moving its ears around. It is not picky about where it lives—it will make its nest anywhere.
ZKN_ALPHA_020_000	Raticate's sturdy fangs grow steadily. To keep them ground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses.
ZKN_ALPHA_021_000	Spearow has a very loud cry that can be heard over half a mile away. If its high, keening cry is heard echoing all around, it is a sign that they are warning each other of danger.
ZKN_ALPHA_022_000	Fearow is recognized by its long neck and elongated beak. They are conveniently shaped for catching prey in soil or water. It deftly moves its long and skinny beak to pluck prey.
ZKN_ALPHA_023_000	Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. Assuming this position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any direction with a glare from its upraised head.
ZKN_ALPHA_024_000	This Pokémon is terrifically strong in order to constrict things with its body. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once Arbok wraps its body around its foe, escaping its crunching embrace is impossible.
ZKN_ALPHA_025_000	This Pokémon has electricity-storing pouches on its cheeks. These appear to become electrically charged during the night while Pikachu sleeps. It occasionally discharges electricity when it is dozy after waking up.
ZKN_ALPHA_026_000	This Pokémon exudes a weak electrical charge from all over its body that makes it take on a slight glow in darkness. Raichu plants its tail in the ground to discharge electricity.
ZKN_ALPHA_027_000	Sandshrew has a very dry hide that is extremely tough. The Pokémon can roll into a ball that repels any attack. At night, it burrows into the desert sand to sleep.
ZKN_ALPHA_028_000	Sandslash can roll up its body as if it were a ball covered with large spikes. In battle, this Pokémon will try to make the foe flinch by jabbing it with its spines. It then leaps at the stunned foe to tear wildly with its sharp claws.
ZKN_ALPHA_029_000	Nidoran♀ has barbs that secrete a powerful poison. They are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pokémon. When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn.
ZKN_ALPHA_030_000	When Nidorina are with their friends or family, they keep their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other. This Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated from the others.
ZKN_ALPHA_031_000	Nidoqueen's body is encased in extremely hard scales. It is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young.
ZKN_ALPHA_032_000	Nidoran♂ has developed muscles for moving its ears. Thanks to them, the ears can be freely moved in any direction. Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon's notice.
ZKN_ALPHA_033_000	Nidorino has a horn that is harder than a diamond. If it senses a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once, and it challenges the foe with all its might.
ZKN_ALPHA_034_000	Nidoking's thick tail packs enormously destructive power. With one swing, it can topple a metal transmission tower. Once this Pokémon goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it.
ZKN_ALPHA_035_000	On every night of a full moon, groups of this Pokémon come out to play. When dawn arrives, the tired Clefairy return to their quiet mountain retreats and go to sleep nestled up against each other.
ZKN_ALPHA_036_000	Clefable moves by skipping lightly as if it were flying using its wings. Its bouncy step lets it even walk on water. It is known to take strolls on lakes on quiet, moonlit nights.
ZKN_ALPHA_037_000	Inside Vulpix's body burns a flame that never goes out. During the daytime, when the temperatures rise, this Pokémon releases flames from its mouth to prevent its body from growing too hot.
ZKN_ALPHA_038_000	Legend has it that Ninetales came into being when nine wizards possessing sacred powers merged into one. This Pokémon is highly intelligent—it can understand human speech.
ZKN_ALPHA_039_000	When this Pokémon sings, it never pauses to breathe. If it is in a battle against an opponent that does not easily fall asleep, Jigglypuff cannot breathe, endangering its life.
ZKN_ALPHA_040_000	Wigglytuff's body is very flexible. By inhaling deeply, this Pokémon can inflate itself seemingly without end. Once inflated, Wigglytuff bounces along lightly like a balloon.
ZKN_ALPHA_041_000	Zubat avoids sunlight because exposure causes it to become unhealthy. During the daytime, it stays in caves or under the eaves of old houses, sleeping while hanging upside down.
ZKN_ALPHA_042_000	Golbat bites down on prey with its four fangs and drinks the victim's blood. It becomes active on inky dark moonless nights, flying around to attack people and Pokémon.
ZKN_ALPHA_043_000	Oddish searches for fertile, nutrient-rich soil, then plants itself. During the daytime, while it is planted, this Pokémon's feet are thought to change shape and become similar to the roots of trees.
ZKN_ALPHA_044_000	From its mouth Gloom drips honey that smells absolutely horrible. Apparently, it loves the horrid stench. It sniffs the noxious fumes and then drools even more of its honey.
ZKN_ALPHA_045_000	Vileplume has the world's largest petals. They are used to attract prey that are then doused with toxic spores. Once the prey are immobilized, this Pokémon catches and devours them.
ZKN_ALPHA_046_000	Paras has parasitic mushrooms growing on its back called tochukaso. They grow large by drawing nutrients from this Bug Pokémon host. They are highly valued as a medicine for extending life.
ZKN_ALPHA_047_000	Parasect is known to infest large trees en masse and drain nutrients from the lower trunk and roots. When an infested tree dies, they move onto another tree all at once.
ZKN_ALPHA_048_000	Venonat is said to have evolved with a coat of thin, stiff hair that covers its entire body for protection. It possesses large eyes that never fail to spot even minuscule prey.
ZKN_ALPHA_049_000	Venomoth is nocturnal—it is a Pokémon that only becomes active at night. Its favorite prey are small insects that gather around streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness.
ZKN_ALPHA_050_000	Diglett are raised in most farms. The reason is simple— wherever this Pokémon burrows, the soil is left perfectly tilled for planting crops. This soil is made ideal for growing delicious vegetables.
ZKN_ALPHA_051_000	Dugtrio are actually triplets that emerged from one body. As a result, each triplet thinks exactly like the other two triplets. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly.
ZKN_ALPHA_052_000	Meowth withdraws its sharp claws into its paws to slinkily sneak about without making any incriminating footsteps. For some reason, this Pokémon loves shiny coins that glitter with light.
ZKN_ALPHA_053_000	Persian has six bold whiskers that give it a look of toughness. The whiskers sense air movements to determine what is in the Pokémon's surrounding vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed by the whiskers.
ZKN_ALPHA_054_000	If it uses its mysterious power, Psyduck can't remember having done so. It apparently can't form a memory of such an event because it goes into an altered state that is much like deep sleep.
ZKN_ALPHA_055_000	Golduck is the fastest swimmer among all Pokémon. It swims effortlessly, even in a rough, stormy sea. It sometimes rescues people from wrecked ships floundering in high seas.
ZKN_ALPHA_056_000	When Mankey starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns rough, it's a sure sign that it is becoming angry. However, because it goes into a towering rage almost instantly, it is impossible for anyone to flee its wrath.
ZKN_ALPHA_057_000	When Primeape becomes furious, its blood circulation is boosted. In turn, its muscles are made even stronger. However, it also becomes much less intelligent at the same time.
ZKN_ALPHA_058_000	Growlithe has a superb sense of smell. Once it smells anything, this Pokémon won't forget the scent, no matter what. It uses its advanced olfactory sense to determine the emotions of other living things.
ZKN_ALPHA_059_000	Arcanine is known for its high speed. It is said to be capable of running over 6,200 miles in a single day and night. The fire that blazes wildly within this Pokémon's body is its source of power.
ZKN_ALPHA_060_000	Poliwag has a very thin skin. It is possible to see the Pokémon's spiral innards right through the skin. Despite its thinness, however, the skin is also very flexible. Even sharp fangs bounce right off it.
ZKN_ALPHA_061_000	The surface of Poliwhirl's body is always wet and slick with a slimy fluid. Because of this slippery covering, it can easily slip and slide out of the clutches of any enemy in battle.
ZKN_ALPHA_062_000	Poliwrath's highly developed, brawny muscles never grow fatigued, however much it exercises. It is so tirelessly strong, this Pokémon can swim back and forth across the ocean without effort.
ZKN_ALPHA_063_000	Abra needs to sleep for eighteen hours a day. If it doesn't, this Pokémon loses its ability to use telekinetic powers. If it is attacked, Abra escapes using Teleport while it is still sleeping.
ZKN_ALPHA_064_000	Kadabra holds a silver spoon in its hand. The spoon is used to amplify the alpha waves in its brain. Without the spoon, the Pokémon is said to be limited to half the usual amount of its telekinetic powers.
ZKN_ALPHA_065_000	Alakazam's brain continually grows, infinitely multiplying brain cells. This amazing brain gives this Pokémon an astoundingly high IQ of 5,000. It has a thorough memory of everything that has occurred in the world.
ZKN_ALPHA_066_000	Machop exercises by hefting around a Graveler as if it were a barbell. There are some Machop that travel the world in a quest to master all kinds of martial arts.
ZKN_ALPHA_067_000	Machoke undertakes bodybuilding every day even as it helps people with tough, physically demanding labor. On its days off, this Pokémon heads to the fields and mountains to exercise and train.
ZKN_ALPHA_068_000	Machamp is known as the Pokémon that has mastered every kind of martial arts. If it grabs hold of the foe with its four arms, the battle is all but over. The hapless foe is thrown far over the horizon.
ZKN_ALPHA_069_000	Bellsprout's thin and flexible body lets it bend and sway to avoid any attack, however strong it may be. From its mouth, this Pokémon spits a corrosive fluid that melts even iron.
ZKN_ALPHA_070_000	Weepinbell has a large hook on its rear end. At night, the Pokémon hooks on to a tree branch and goes to sleep. If it moves around in its sleep, it may wake up to find itself on the ground.
ZKN_ALPHA_071_000	Victreebel has a long vine that extends from its head. This vine is waved and flicked about as if it were an animal to attract prey. When an unsuspecting prey draws near, this Pokémon swallows it whole.
ZKN_ALPHA_072_000	Tentacool absorbs sunlight and refracts it using water inside its body to convert it into beam energy. This Pokémon shoots beams from the small round organ above its eyes.
ZKN_ALPHA_073_000	Tentacruel has tentacles that can be freely elongated and shortened at will. It ensnares prey with its tentacles and weakens the prey by dosing it with a harsh toxin. It can catch up to 80 prey at the same time.
ZKN_ALPHA_074_000	When Geodude sleeps deeply, it buries itself halfway into the ground. It will not awaken even if hikers step on it unwittingly. In the morning, this Pokémon rolls downhill in search of food.
ZKN_ALPHA_075_000	Rocks are Graveler's favorite food. This Pokémon will climb a mountain from the base to the summit, crunchingly feasting on rocks all the while. Upon reaching the peak, it rolls back down to the bottom.
ZKN_ALPHA_076_000	Golem is known for rolling down from mountains. To prevent them from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves have been dug into the sides of mountains to serve as guideways for diverting this Pokémon's course.
ZKN_ALPHA_077_000	Ponyta is very weak at birth. It can barely stand up. This Pokémon becomes stronger by stumbling and falling to keep up with its parent.
ZKN_ALPHA_078_000	Rapidash usually can be seen casually cantering in the fields and plains. However, when this Pokémon turns serious, its fiery manes flare and blaze as it gallops its way up to 150 mph.
ZKN_ALPHA_079_000	Slowpoke uses its tail to catch prey by dipping it in water at the side of a river. However, this Pokémon often forgets what it's doing and often spends entire days just loafing at water's edge.
ZKN_ALPHA_080_000	Slowbro's tail has a Shellder firmly attached with a bite. As a result, the tail can't be used for fishing anymore. This causes Slowbro to grudgingly swim and catch prey instead.
ZKN_ALPHA_081_000	Magnemite floats in the air by emitting electromagnetic waves from the units at its sides. These waves block gravity. This Pokémon becomes incapable of flight if its internal electrical supply is depleted.
ZKN_ALPHA_082_000	Magneton emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to electronics and precision instruments. Because of this, it is said that some towns warn people to keep this Pokémon inside a Poké Ball.
ZKN_ALPHA_083_000	Farfetch'd is always seen with a stalk from a plant of some sort. Apparently, there are good stalks and bad stalks. This Pokémon has been known to fight with others over stalks.
ZKN_ALPHA_084_000	Doduo's two heads contain completely identical brains. A scientific study reported that on rare occasions, there will be examples of this Pokémon possessing different sets of brains.
ZKN_ALPHA_085_000	Apparently, the heads aren't the only parts of the body that Dodrio has three of. It has three sets of hearts and lungs as well, so it is capable of running long distances without rest.
ZKN_ALPHA_086_000	Seel hunts for prey in the frigid sea underneath sheets of ice. When it needs to breathe, it punches a hole through the ice with the sharply protruding section of its head.
ZKN_ALPHA_087_000	Dewgong loves to snooze on bitterly cold ice. The sight of this Pokémon sleeping on a glacier was mistakenly thought to be a mermaid by a mariner long ago.
ZKN_ALPHA_088_000	Grimer emerged from the sludge that settled on a polluted seabed. This Pokémon loves anything filthy. It constantly leaks a horribly germ-infested fluid from all over its body.
ZKN_ALPHA_089_000	This Pokémon's favorite food is anything that is repugnantly filthy. In dirty towns where people think nothing of throwing away litter on the streets, Muk are certain to gather.
ZKN_ALPHA_090_000	At night, this Pokémon uses its broad tongue to burrow a hole in the seafloor sand and then sleep in it. While it is sleeping, Shellder closes its shell, but leaves its tongue hanging out.
ZKN_ALPHA_091_000	Cloyster is capable of swimming in the sea. It does so by swallowing water, then jetting it out toward the rear. This Pokémon shoots spikes from its shell using the same system.
ZKN_ALPHA_092_000	Gastly is largely composed of gaseous matter. When exposed to a strong wind, the gaseous body quickly dwindles away. Groups of this Pokémon cluster under the eaves of houses to escape the ravages of wind.
ZKN_ALPHA_093_000	Haunter is a dangerous Pokémon. If one beckons you while floating in darkness, you must never approach it. This Pokémon will try to lick you with its tongue and steal your life away.
ZKN_ALPHA_094_000	Sometimes, on a dark night, your shadow thrown by a streetlight will suddenly and startlingly overtake you. It is actually a Gengar running past you, pretending to be your shadow.
ZKN_ALPHA_095_000	Onix has a magnet in its brain. It acts as a compass so that this Pokémon does not lose direction while it is tunneling. As it grows older, its body becomes increasingly rounder and smoother.
ZKN_ALPHA_096_000	If your nose becomes itchy while you are sleeping, it's a sure sign that one of these Pokémon is standing above your pillow and trying to eat your dream through your nostrils.
ZKN_ALPHA_097_000	Hypno holds a pendulum in its hand. The arcing movement and glitter of the pendulum lull the foe into a deep state of hypnosis. While this Pokémon searches for prey, it polishes the pendulum.
ZKN_ALPHA_098_000	Krabby live on beaches, burrowed inside holes dug into the sand. On sandy beaches with little in the way of food, these Pokémon can be seen squabbling with each other over territory.
ZKN_ALPHA_099_000	Kingler has an enormous, oversized claw. It waves this huge claw in the air to communicate with others. However, because the claw is so heavy, the Pokémon quickly tires.
ZKN_ALPHA_100_000	Voltorb is extremely sensitive—it explodes at the slightest of shocks. It is rumored that it was first created when a Poké Ball was exposed to a powerful pulse of energy.
ZKN_ALPHA_101_000	One of Electrode's characteristics is its attraction to electricity. It is a problematical Pokémon that congregates mostly at electrical power plants to feed on electricity that has just been generated.
ZKN_ALPHA_102_000	This Pokémon consists of six eggs that form a closely knit cluster. The six eggs attract each other and spin around. When cracks increasingly appear on the eggs, Exeggcute is close to evolution.
ZKN_ALPHA_103_000	Exeggutor originally came from the tropics. Its heads steadily grow larger from exposure to strong sunlight. It is said that when the heads fall off, they group together to form Exeggcute.
ZKN_ALPHA_104_000	Cubone pines for the mother it will never see again. Seeing a likeness of its mother in the full moon, it cries. The stains on the skull the Pokémon wears are made by the tears it sheds.
ZKN_ALPHA_105_000	Marowak is the evolved form of a Cubone that has overcome its sadness at the loss of its mother and grown tough. This Pokémon's tempered and hardened spirit is not easily broken.
ZKN_ALPHA_106_000	Hitmonlee's legs freely contract and stretch. Using these springlike legs, it bowls over foes with devastating kicks. After battle, it rubs down its legs and loosens the muscles to overcome fatigue.
ZKN_ALPHA_107_000	Hitmonchan is said to possess the spirit of a boxer who had been working toward a world championship. This Pokémon has an indomitable spirit and will never give up in the face of adversity.
ZKN_ALPHA_108_000	Whenever Lickitung comes across something new, it will unfailingly give it a lick. It does so because it memorizes things by texture and by taste. It is somewhat put off by sour things.
ZKN_ALPHA_109_000	Koffing embodies toxic substances. It mixes the toxins with raw garbage to set off a chemical reaction that results in a terribly powerful poison gas. The higher the temperature, the more gas is concocted by this Pokémon.
ZKN_ALPHA_110_000	Weezing alternately shrinks and inflates its twin bodies to mix together toxic gases inside. The more the gases are mixed, the more powerful the toxins become. The Pokémon also becomes more putrid.
ZKN_ALPHA_111_000	Rhyhorn's brain is very small. It is so dense, while on a run it forgets why it started running in the first place. It apparently remembers sometimes if it demolishes something.
ZKN_ALPHA_112_000	Rhydon has a horn that serves as a drill. It is used for destroying rocks and boulders. This Pokémon occasionally rams into streams of magma, but the armor-like hide prevents it from feeling the heat.
ZKN_ALPHA_113_000	Chansey lays nutritionally excellent eggs on an everyday basis. The eggs are so delicious, they are easily and eagerly devoured by even those people who have lost their appetite.
ZKN_ALPHA_114_000	Tangela's vines snap off easily if they are grabbed. This happens without pain, allowing it to make a quick getaway. The lost vines are replaced by newly grown vines the very next day.
ZKN_ALPHA_115_000	If you come across a young Kangaskhan playing by itself, you must never disturb it or attempt to catch it. The baby Pokémon's parent is sure to be in the area, and it will become violently enraged at you.
ZKN_ALPHA_116_000	If Horsea senses danger, it will reflexively spray a dense black ink from its mouth and try to escape. This Pokémon swims by cleverly flapping the fin on its back.
ZKN_ALPHA_117_000	Seadra generates whirlpools by spinning its body. The whirlpools are strong enough to swallow even fishing boats. This Pokémon weakens prey with these currents, then swallows it whole.
ZKN_ALPHA_118_000	Goldeen loves swimming wild and free in rivers and ponds. If one of these Pokémon is placed in an aquarium, it will shatter even the thickest glass with one ram of its horn and make its escape.
ZKN_ALPHA_119_000	Seaking is very protective of its eggs. The male and female will take turns patrolling around their nest and eggs. The guarding of eggs by these Pokémon goes on for over a month.

ZKN_ALPHA_676_009	Historically, in the Kalos region, these Pokémon were the designated guardians of the king.
ZKN_ALPHA_678_001	The eyeball patterns on the interior of its ears emit psychic energy. It keeps the patterns tightly covered because that power is too immense.
ZKN_ALPHA_681_001	Apparently, it can detect the innate qualities of leadership. According to legend, whoever it recognizes is destined to become king.

ZKN_ARCEUS_024_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_025_000	Possesses cheek sacs in which it stores electricity. This clever forest-dweller roasts tough berries with an electric shock before consuming them.
ZKN_ARCEUS_026_000	It can discharge bursts of electricity exceeding 100,000 volts— a single strike with that amount of power would incapacitate one of the Copperajah of my homeland.

ZKN_ARCEUS_034_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_035_000	It can be found in quiet mountain areas on a full moon's night. Its dancing and its tiny, faintly glowing wings confer upon it a lovely fairylike quality.
ZKN_ARCEUS_036_000	Legend says that on clear, quiet nights, it listens for the voices of its kin living on the moon. I, too, often think of my homeland, so far away.
ZKN_ARCEUS_037_000	In its belly burns a fire, which Vulpix spits out in the form of fireballs. When young, this Pokémon has but one white tail. As the Pokémon matures, this single tail splits into six.
ZKN_ARCEUS_038_000	The coat of gleaming golden fur is quite magnificent. This species is said to store sacred power in its nine long tails and to live for a millennium.
ZKN_ARCEUS_039_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_040_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_041_000	Makes its home in gloomy caves. Atrophied eyes have left this Pokémon blind, so it scans its surroundings via sound waves that it emits from its mouth as it flies.
ZKN_ARCEUS_042_000	It sinks its sharp fangs into other creatures and slurps up their blood. A closer look at the fangs reveals that they are hollow and akin to straws.
ZKN_ARCEUS_043_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_044_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_045_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_046_000	Sometimes seen at the foot of trees in humid forests. The mushrooms on its back—called tochukaso—are not present on infant specimens and instead emerge as Paras matures.
ZKN_ARCEUS_047_000	Mushroom-lacking specimens of this Pokémon lie unmoving in the forest, lending credence to the hypothesis that the large mushroom is in control of Parasect's actions.

ZKN_ARCEUS_052_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_053_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_054_000	Suffers perpetual headaches. If the agony grows too great, Psyduck's latent power erupts, contrary to Psyduck's intent. Ergo, I am exploring ways to ease the pain.
ZKN_ARCEUS_055_000	Its body is strong, and it has webbing on its hands and feet. Golduck can swim easily through rough seas, clawing its way through the high waves.
ZKN_ARCEUS_056_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_057_000

ZKN_ARCEUS_061_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_062_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_063_000	Spends 18 hours of the day sleeping. Even while asleep, Abra can control its psychic powers—should danger approach, the Pokémon will simply teleport away.
ZKN_ARCEUS_064_000	There are rumors that a child with mystical powers became a Kadabra; however, this remains unverified. I suspect that the spoon Kadabra holds enhances its brain waves.
ZKN_ARCEUS_065_000	The longer Alakazam lives, the larger and heavier its head becomes. Our tests have shown that the strength of its psychic powers correlates positively to the weight of its head.
ZKN_ARCEUS_066_000	Though as small as a child, it has strength enough to easily throw a well-built adult. Striving to become ever stronger, Machop trains by carrying a Graveler on its shoulders.
ZKN_ARCEUS_067_000	A sturdy creature boasting a robust physique and boundless stamina. Loves training above all else and voluntarily assists with tasks such as construction and clearing land.
ZKN_ARCEUS_068_000	In close combat, its four arms afford it offensive and defensive supremacy. In but a blink, this valiant Pokémon can overwhelm its foes with more than 1,000 blows from its fists.
ZKN_ARCEUS_069_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_070_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_071_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_072_000	They fire beams from the glassy, magenta orbs that resemble eyes atop their heads, and they drift in shallow seas. During low tide, they can sometimes be found on beaches, desiccated.
ZKN_ARCEUS_073_000	It has 80 tentacles, each with a venomous tip. These tentacles are also extendible, lengthening when Tentacruel attempts to catch prey. Use caution.
ZKN_ARCEUS_074_000	Makes its home in mountainous regions, using its arms to climb along harsh mountain roads. Can be troublesome—carelessly kicking one will cause it to fly into a rage and chase after you.
ZKN_ARCEUS_075_000	Dwells in holes dug into sheer walls of stone. It enjoys rolling down slopes as though it were a boulder during a rockfall, so keep an eye upward while traversing mountain roads.
ZKN_ARCEUS_076_000	The rocklike shell is shed each year. The cast-off shell then crumbles, reverting to a mass of soil, which can be spread across fields to promote crop growth.
ZKN_ARCEUS_077_000	These Pokémon live in herds out in the grassland. Newborn foals lack their fiery manes, which will develop about an hour after birth.
ZKN_ARCEUS_078_000	Fiery mane aglow, Rapidash darts like an arrow across the land. This prodigiously swift creature can traverse the vast region of Hisui in a day and a half.
ZKN_ARCEUS_079_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_080_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_081_000	A bizarre Pokémon with but a single eye embedded in an iron sphere. I suspect this creature levitates due to the magnetism it emits from its arms, which resemble horseshoe-shaped magnets.
ZKN_ARCEUS_082_000	Three Magnemite gathered to evolve into this Pokémon. The source of much vexation on my part, as its powerful magnetism destroys my research equipment.

ZKN_ARCEUS_090_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_091_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_092_000	Gaseous and completely impalpable. Also highly dangerous— inhaling part of its poisonous body will cause one to faint instantly.
ZKN_ARCEUS_093_000	This frightful, malevolent spirit can glide through walls, appearing wherever it likes. According to rumor, victims of a Haunter's lick will wither to death day by day.
ZKN_ARCEUS_094_000	Possesses potential victims' shadows in an effort to steal away the victims' lives. If your shadow begins to laugh, you must take hold of a protective charm posthaste!
ZKN_ARCEUS_095_000	This chain of immense stones resembles a giant serpent. Tremors shake the earth above as it burrows deep beneath the ground, feeding on boulders as it goes.

ZKN_ARCEUS_106_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_107_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_108_000	Wields its long tongue deftly, as though it were an arm. The Pokémon's viscous saliva, once it has been collected and boiled down, yields a strong and highly useful adhesive.
ZKN_ARCEUS_109_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_110_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_111_000	Ludicrously strong—when it butts heads with a mountain, it is the mountain that shatters. But its short legs struggle with turns, and it is incapable of stopping unless it collides with something.
ZKN_ARCEUS_112_000	Rapidly rotates its horn to bore through bedrock. It swaggers around volcanic regions, protected from the lava's heat by its tough, armorlike hide.
ZKN_ARCEUS_113_000	This purehearted Pokémon shares its eggs with the injured. These eggs are so nutritious that they've been nicknamed "doctors' doubles."
ZKN_ARCEUS_114_000	It is cloaked entirely in blue vines, preventing any glimpse of its true identity. The vines impart a refreshing sensation when chewed—they're useful as a spice.
ZKN_ARCEUS_115_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_116_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_117_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_118_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_119_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_120_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_121_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_122_000	The behavior of this clown-like Pokémon reminds one of pantomime. It creates invisible walls using a force emitted from its fingertips.
ZKN_ARCEUS_123_000	The large, wickedly sharp scythes on its forearms are truly fearsome weapons. Prey's attempts to flee are unfailingly thwarted by this Pokémon's nimble motions.
ZKN_ARCEUS_124_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_125_000	Feeds on electrical energy. During sudden showers beneath looming thunderclouds, one can observe Electabuzz scaling tall trees, where the Pokémon will then wait for lightning to strike.
ZKN_ARCEUS_126_000	Legend has it that this Pokémon was born from the crater of a volcano. When wounded, it bathes in lava to heal its body, much as one would soak in a hot spring.
ZKN_ARCEUS_127_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_128_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_129_000	A feeble, pitiful imbecile of a Pokémon that is nonetheless very hardy. Unperturbed by turbid water, it can be found living in all sorts of places.
ZKN_ARCEUS_130_000	I suspect this Pokémon to be the true identity of a dragon written of in ancient texts, which claimed that it razed an entire village with white-hot beams from its maw.
ZKN_ARCEUS_131_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_132_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_133_000	Harbors the potential to evolve into manifold forms. Within Eevee lies the key to the mysteries of Pokémon evolution—I'm certain of it.
ZKN_ARCEUS_134_000	Tests show that its cells closely resemble water molecules, which perhaps explains its ability to conceal its form while submerged. I believe the origins of mermaid folklore lie with this Pokémon.
ZKN_ARCEUS_135_000	Bristles its fur into sharp, needlelike points when enraged. One can hear electricity crackle in its breath when it exhales.
ZKN_ARCEUS_136_000	Flames burn within a saclike organ inside this Pokémon. When Flareon inhales, these flames grow in intensity, reaching a mighty 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
ZKN_ARCEUS_137_000	It has no discernible heartbeat and does not seem to draw breath, and yet it appears to function without issue. I cannot even begin to explain this utterly bizarre anomaly.
ZKN_ARCEUS_138_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_139_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_140_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_141_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_142_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_143_000	This glutton appears in villages without warning and devours the entirety of their rice granaries—such occurrences have long been counted among the gravest of disasters.

ZKN_ARCEUS_153_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_154_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_155_000	Hails from the Johto region. Though usually curled into a ball due to its timid disposition, it harbors tremendous firepower.
ZKN_ARCEUS_156_000	This creature's fur is most mysterious—it is wholly impervious to the burning touch of flame. Should Quilava turn its back to you, take heed! Such a posture indicates a forthcoming attack.
ZKN_ARCEUS_157_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_158_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_159_000

ZKN_ARCEUS_166_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_167_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_168_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_169_000	Its hind limbs have become another set of wings. Crobat expertly maneuvers its four wings to dart in exquisite fashion through even the most confined caves without losing any speed.
ZKN_ARCEUS_170_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_171_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_172_000	Pichu stores electricity in the sacs on its cheeks but discharges it inadvertently when agitated or excited. Being yet immature, the Pokémon's handling of electricity is rather inept.
ZKN_ARCEUS_173_000	In silhouette, they resemble twinkling starlight. When shooting stars rain from the night sky, Cleffa gather in numbers and dance as though they are indeed incarnations of the stars.
ZKN_ARCEUS_174_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_175_000	This ovate creature is frequently mistaken for a moving egg when encountered out in the fields or in the mountains. Its guileless smile soothes the soul.
ZKN_ARCEUS_176_000	No records exist of Togetic being seen in the wilds. Rumors abound that it evolves under the loving care of a trusted human companion, upon whom the Pokémon then bestows great joy.
ZKN_ARCEUS_177_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_178_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_179_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_180_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_181_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_182_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_183_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_184_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_185_000	Though it pretends to be a tree, it fails to fool even children. To the touch, its body feels more like rock than tree bark. Sudowoodo's extreme aversion to water merits special note.
ZKN_ARCEUS_186_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_187_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_188_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_189_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_190_000	This treetop dweller possesses a tail as dexterous as a hand. Ancient writings describe this Pokémon as a one-armed oddity.
ZKN_ARCEUS_191_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_192_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_193_000	Its frail wings are so thin that one can see clear through them. However, during flight these wings exhibit the power to churn air with force enough to launch a house skyward.
ZKN_ARCEUS_194_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_195_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_196_000	Wields an arcane power with which it can predict the weather and even people's thoughts. When bathed in sunshine, the scarlet orb on its brow glows and builds energy.
ZKN_ARCEUS_197_000	It is most active in the wee hours of the night, when moonlight bathes the land. Its large eyes can pierce the darkness and perceive prey with absolute clarity.
ZKN_ARCEUS_198_000	Widely shunned as a bearer of ill fortune. Upon crossing paths with this creature, I've been told one must chant "Workrum, Workrum—bad luck, don't come" as a protective incantation.
ZKN_ARCEUS_199_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_200_000	It conceals itself in darkness, sending chills up travelers' spines with its childlike weeping. As it observes the frightened travelers with glee, the red orbs upon its chest let off an eerie light.
ZKN_ARCEUS_201_000	It is hard to believe these strangely shaped Pokémon are truly living creatures. I've pointed out that the species' many forms resemble writing from other lands; no one will take me seriously.
ZKN_ARCEUS_202_000

ZKN_ARCEUS_204_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_205_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_206_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_207_000	Its tail is tipped by a thick, horrible stinger. To bring down prey, it will first obscure their vision by covering their faces with its body, and then it will use the stinger to inject them with venom.
ZKN_ARCEUS_208_000	This Pokémon evolved through use of a strange item. Its body is coated with steel powder and notably hard—not even diamond can leave so much as a scratch.
ZKN_ARCEUS_209_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_210_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_211_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_212_000	Evolved by way of a curious item. The shell covering its body has been shown to be stronger than forged steel.
ZKN_ARCEUS_213_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_214_000	This Pokémon has an unparalleled horn. Heracross itself demonstrates tremendous power—it's capable of throwing several people trained in the traditional arts of war at once.
ZKN_ARCEUS_215_000	This Pokémon shares roots with the Sneasel of Hisui, but unlike that species, this one is spiteful in personality. I hypothesize that water and earth can affect Sneasel's mind and body.
ZKN_ARCEUS_216_000	It licks its paws because of the sweet honey that has soaked into them. It is cunning, stealing into the nests of Combee and taking for itself the honey that the Combee have amassed.
ZKN_ARCEUS_217_000	When the cold season arrives in Hisui, this Pokémon will wander fields and mountains alike in search of its favorite berries. Ursaring's hunger during this time makes it a ferocious danger.
ZKN_ARCEUS_218_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_219_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_220_000	Swinub excels at sniffing out mushrooms buried beneath grass or snow. Since ancient times, the people of Hisui have often relied upon this skill.
ZKN_ARCEUS_221_000	The long fur of this Pokémon covers its eyes, ears, and even limbs, allowing Piloswine to resist harshly frigid conditions. The Pokémon's white tusks can be used to defeat its enemies.
ZKN_ARCEUS_222_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_223_000	Spits water from its mouth with incredible accuracy. It captures Burmy by shooting them down off the branches from which they dangle.
ZKN_ARCEUS_224_000	While Octillery still shoots water from its mouth, the drastic anatomical difference between it and Remoraid meant that for a long time, no one believed the former evolved from the latter.
ZKN_ARCEUS_225_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_226_000	This calm and gentle Pokémon swims gracefully through the sea. After building speed, it can leap out of the water. It is often misidentified as a bird Pokémon due to this behavior.
ZKN_ARCEUS_227_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_228_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_229_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_230_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_231_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_232_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_233_000	A bizarre item caused this Pokémon to evolve. While it now exhibits many new gestures and expressions, its biology remains inscrutable.
ZKN_ARCEUS_234_000	Its strangely shaped antlers have the power to bewitch those who see them. Medicine made by grinding up the black orbs from fallen antlers is an effective treatment for insomnia.
ZKN_ARCEUS_235_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_236_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_237_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_238_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_239_000	They generate electricity by spinning their arms. During a thunderstorm, if one hears the lively voices of children out in the wilderness, what one is actually hearing are the voices of Elekid.
ZKN_ARCEUS_240_000	This Pokémon lives in volcanic areas. With each breath, sparks spurt from its mouth and nose. When Magby is in good health, its flames gain a yellow tint.
ZKN_ARCEUS_241_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_242_000	A kindhearted Pokémon that will care for any sick person or Pokémon until their health improves. The eggs it lays are delicious and bring good fortune to those who eat them.

ZKN_ARCEUS_263_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_264_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_265_000	Likes sap and is abundant in the wild. Why it evolves into various different forms is unknown. One cannot tell from a Wurmple's appearance which form it will take when it evolves.
ZKN_ARCEUS_266_000	Wraps itself in thin strings of silk while it stores energy for evolution. It can't extend its limbs and its movement is slow, but its eyes keep a sharp lookout—Silcoon is always on guard.
ZKN_ARCEUS_267_000	A colorful and incredibly beautiful but also greedy Pokémon. In an effort to keep its favorite food all to itself, it will chase away Combee as they try to gather nectar.
ZKN_ARCEUS_268_000	The silk coating its body is thin but sufficiently strong. Cascoon's silk has a luster and texture superior to that of Silcoon's, and clothes made using Cascoon silk are regarded as top-notch.
ZKN_ARCEUS_269_000	Tends to be drawn to bonfires on dark nights. Difficult to chase away from settlements because of the way it scatters highly toxic scales.

ZKN_ARCEUS_278_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_279_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_280_000	Tends to prefer people with a chipper disposition to those who are gloomy, but it has shown no discrimination with regard to age or gender. Needs more research.
ZKN_ARCEUS_281_000	It resembles a maiden in appearance, but it wields strange powers to project visions of paradise. I suspect the crimson ornaments on its head are the key to its abilities.
ZKN_ARCEUS_282_000	It will dedicate itself to defending a master it has come to adore. Its pure white dress, reminiscent of those worn by ladies of nobility, is the dress of one who is willing to risk their life.

ZKN_ARCEUS_297_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_298_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_299_000	Once the people of Hisui discovered that its red nose always points north, they grew to rely on it greatly when traveling afar. The nose seems to work in a similar way to ancient compasses.

ZKN_ARCEUS_313_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_314_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_315_000	Though beautiful, it has highly poisonous thorns. There is an old tradition in my homeland wherein one would send these thorns to an opponent to challenge them to a duel.

ZKN_ARCEUS_337_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_338_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_339_000	Makes its home in swamps with murky water. The poor visibility hides this Pokémon from predators, and the slime on its body makes grasping it difficult.
ZKN_ARCEUS_340_000	Strikes its caudal fin against the swamp bed to shake the ground and startle its prey. It will then swallow the fleeing prey whole. People mistook this behavior as the cause of earthquakes.

ZKN_ARCEUS_353_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_354_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_355_000	I've heard that the children of Hisui all begin to behave once they've been told the story of how this Pokémon roams about before the witching hour to spirit away misbehaving children.
ZKN_ARCEUS_356_000	There are rumors that peeking inside its bandage-wrapped body will cause one to get pulled in through the gaps between the bandages, never to return. I've been too scared to verify.
ZKN_ARCEUS_357_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_358_000	Can emit waves of air powerful enough to knock out prey taller than itself. I hypothesize that it amplifies the faint sound of wind within its body.
ZKN_ARCEUS_359_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_360_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_361_000	Arrives alongside the first snow. It's thought that homes Snorunt visit will prosper for many generations. By tradition, one might offer a lump of ice made from pure water at one's front door.
ZKN_ARCEUS_362_000	It covers its body with an armor of ice harder than steel. Uses its breath to freeze prey, which it then devours as if they were frozen desserts.
ZKN_ARCEUS_363_000	During the season when drift ice approaches the shore, Spheal prefers living on the ice—where fewer predators lurk—rather than the land. Its fur retains heat superbly and resists harsh cold.
ZKN_ARCEUS_364_000	Its white whiskers are very sensitive. Sealeo will balance Spheal on the tip of its nose, checking its scent and its feel to be sure the Spheal is healthy.
ZKN_ARCEUS_365_000	Its thick tusks are strong enough to shatter drift ice. They have been known to break, but they will grow back by the next year. The Hisui region is well known for these broken tusks.

ZKN_ARCEUS_385_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_386_000	
ZKN_ARCEUS_387_000	This Pokémon becomes more energetic the more sunlight there is. The part resembling a shell is similar to silt and is slightly damp and warm to the touch.
ZKN_ARCEUS_388_000	Appears where there is clean spring water. The fruit that grows on the shrubs on its shell is sweet, nutritious, and truly delicious.
ZKN_ARCEUS_389_000	This remarkable, large-bodied Pokémon would serve beautifully as borrowed scenery for a garden, and its strength is peerless. Torterra roams the wilderness in search of clean water.
ZKN_ARCEUS_390_000	Full of vigor and always in high spirits. It was once known by the name "Lantern-Tail" and feared as some kind of apparition.
ZKN_ARCEUS_391_000	The deeper the blue on its face, the more powerful it will grow to become. It leaps about every which way and lands powerful blows against its opponents with the flame on its tail.
ZKN_ARCEUS_392_000	A tall, hardy Pokémon with a dazzling appearance. It shrouds itself in flame and battles as if engaged in dance—truly a sight to behold.
ZKN_ARCEUS_393_000	Prefers cold climes and appears along coasts. It's an adorable little thing—as cute as any child—but it's also prideful, unwilling to accept handouts from people.
ZKN_ARCEUS_394_000	It swims gracefully through the frigid sea and sings with a voice like the roaring tide. It has powerful, sturdy wings and dignity to match.
ZKN_ARCEUS_395_000	Since ancient times, it has been revered by the people of Hisui, who call it the Master of the Waves. Its wings are a match for even master-crafted blades.
ZKN_ARCEUS_396_000	They live in the fields and mountains, gathering in large flocks. Their cries are quite obnoxious. Though small, their wings are strong—a strike from them leaves pain that persists for a week.
ZKN_ARCEUS_397_000	They form remarkably large flocks and are constantly fighting amongst themselves. I suspect that those with magnificent plumes on their heads are the strong ones.
ZKN_ARCEUS_398_000	It has left the flock, having gained strength enough to survive on its own. The astounding force with which Staraptor flies through the air allows it to carry away large, burly targets.
ZKN_ARCEUS_399_000	Bidoof has an unsophisticated face and is rarely flustered by anything. There have been incidents involving Bidoof sauntering into villages and gnawing on the houses without a single care.
ZKN_ARCEUS_400_000	Bibarel fur repels water and is also a fantastic material for heat retention. These Pokémon create dams on rivers to live in.
ZKN_ARCEUS_401_000	When the trees take on new hues, more of these Pokémon appear. The tone they create by striking their antennae together resembles that of the marimba, an instrument of foreign lands.
ZKN_ARCEUS_402_000	It uses its cutlass-like arms to produce sound, the melody of which varies from individual to individual. It is a worthwhile endeavor to seek out one's favorite tunes.
ZKN_ARCEUS_403_000	Shakes its body to generate electricity. Its stature belies its aggression—one must be patient to tame this Pokémon.
ZKN_ARCEUS_404_000	Proudly uses its electrified claws as weapons. It seems to be a gracious Pokémon, evenly sharing the spoils of the hunt with others of its kind.
ZKN_ARCEUS_405_000	They form packs, each having one male as leader. Legends say that when Luxray's two eyes shimmer with gold, the Pokémon can see through anything.
ZKN_ARCEUS_406_000	When the sun's light strengthens, the bud atop this Pokémon's head opens. This is a sign to the people that the harsh winter is over, and the season of budding has begun.
ZKN_ARCEUS_407_000	Hidden within the bouquet on each hand are thorned whips loaded with virulent poison. Roserade moves gracefully as it corners its prey and mercilessly lashes them with its whips.
ZKN_ARCEUS_408_000	An incredibly rare sight. They duel each other by ramming their heads together, and the resulting sound echoes throughout the area like the pealing of a bell.
ZKN_ARCEUS_409_000	Very little is known about its biology. Can knock down massive trees by smashing its beautiful, pearl-like crown against them.
ZKN_ARCEUS_410_000	Much remains unknown about this Pokémon, as few have ever seen it. However, we know that it is calm and dislikes conflict, and it enjoys polishing its face against trees and rocks.
ZKN_ARCEUS_411_000	Its face is sturdy—as strong as diamond—and this hardness offers a very stable defense. Much about this species is still unknown, such as its natural habitat.
ZKN_ARCEUS_412_000	If its cloak is even slightly damaged, Burmy will immediately repair it with whatever is close at hand. The Pokémon within the cloak is scrawny and vulnerable to the cold.
ZKN_ARCEUS_413_000	The cloak—fashioned from plant matter—has merged with the Pokémon and is now part of the body, like fur or skin. I suspect this fusion is an effect of the energy involved in evolution.
ZKN_ARCEUS_414_000	Scatters steel-colored scales as it flaps its wings. Despite being observed feeding primarily on the nectar of flowers, Mothim is not often seen around flower gardens.
ZKN_ARCEUS_415_000	They swear fealty to a queen Pokémon and work diligently to gather nectar. Each swarm produces a different flavor of honey.
ZKN_ARCEUS_416_000	Commands its subjects to build its hive. It will dispatch any interlopers who dare sneak into its nest and use them as nourishment for itself.
ZKN_ARCEUS_417_000	A species related to the Pikachu line. Though Pachirisu is a calm Pokémon, it still presents a danger should one touch its electrified tail or cheeks.
ZKN_ARCEUS_418_000	It moves freely in the water by spinning its forked tail for propulsion. The resemblance to the screw of a steamboat is coincidental.
ZKN_ARCEUS_419_000	Has a long, rather splendid flotation sac, which prevents Floatzel from drowning even in stormy seas. One might glimpse this species around fishing hamlets from time to time.
ZKN_ARCEUS_420_000	Once the fruit growing alongside the main body is large and plump, Cherubi will use the nutrients within to evolve. The fruit then detaches, becoming nourishment for other creatures.
ZKN_ARCEUS_421_000	Motionless, save for the occasional quiver. A rich array of Pokémon can be found gathered around it, drawn by the scent exuded from Cherrim's folded petals.
ZKN_ARCEUS_422_000	Found in abundance on seashores bordering warm waters. Shellos are unexpectedly friendly and will crawl toward any person they see. Take care not to get coated in mucus!
ZKN_ARCEUS_423_000	Eats beach sand for nourishment. Should one Gastrodon encounter another of a different color, a fierce battle will inevitably ensue.
ZKN_ARCEUS_424_000	To affirm their kinship, members of this species will form a ring by linking their newly doubled tails together. On rare occasions, humans have been accepted into such rings.
ZKN_ARCEUS_425_000	Said to lure away young children and carry them off to the afterlife. Some whisper that Drifloon are formed of reincarnated human souls, but these rumors are as yet unconfirmed.
ZKN_ARCEUS_426_000	It drifts along at dusk, perfectly silent. Its transient, melancholy aspect touches some people deeply—every so often, one will come upon a song or poem devoted to Drifblim.
ZKN_ARCEUS_427_000	My hypothesis as to why Buneary rolls up its ears is that its hearing is far too keen. I surmise that the Pokémon protects its hearing by limiting the sound that may enter its ears.
ZKN_ARCEUS_428_000	Its fur is warm and yet remarkably light. This Pokémon kicks as though it were a master of karate, driving back its opponents with ease.
ZKN_ARCEUS_429_000	The incantations Mismagius chants can ward against misfortune, so a custom exists of inviting it into one's home. Incur the Pokémon's displeasure, however, and disaster will surely ensue.
ZKN_ARCEUS_430_000	One cry from this Pokémon, and a murder of Murkrow come flying. At such times, one would think the curtain of night had fallen, plunging the world into jet-black darkness.
ZKN_ARCEUS_431_000	Bewitches humans with its helical tail and piercing gaze. Its hidden claws are quite sharp as well, making this Pokémon an exceedingly tricky opponent if antagonized.
ZKN_ARCEUS_432_000	Though impudent and difficult to tame, Purugly enjoys great popularity due to its fur, the beauty of which surpasses even velveteen.
ZKN_ARCEUS_433_000	This Pokémon gave me an excruciating headache when it seemingly cried out without making a sound. Perhaps there are some sounds that the human ear is simply incapable of hearing.
ZKN_ARCEUS_434_000	The poison that gushes from its aft end is accompanied by an utterly evil-smelling odor with such potency that one whiff can induce memory loss.
ZKN_ARCEUS_435_000	Sprays a poisonous fluid to take down prey. Sometimes, unable to stomach the stench of its own fluid, it leaves the bested prey uneaten.
ZKN_ARCEUS_436_000	Floats using a mysterious energy. The pattern engraved upon its back is held as sacred and can sometimes be found in imagery from ancient cemeteries and other such timeworn places.
ZKN_ARCEUS_437_000	Some believe that its bell-like cry opens holes to another world. It has been revered as a deity since ancient times.
ZKN_ARCEUS_438_000	Its tears elicit sympathy from those who see them, but do not be deceived! This expulsion of body water is merely a physiological mechanism for keeping itself in good health.
ZKN_ARCEUS_439_000	Known to turn up in bustling marketplaces now and again. It mimics people much as a child would, then watches how they react, eyes sparkling.
ZKN_ARCEUS_440_000	In imitation of Chansey, it keeps a round stone tucked into its belly pouch and cherishes it dearly. It gets along well with children and will sometimes play house with them for fun.
ZKN_ARCEUS_441_000	A versatile performer skilled in the imitation of human speech. It is said that older, more experienced Chatot can even understand the meaning of the words they mimic.
ZKN_ARCEUS_442_000	It lays curses by thinking wicked thoughts. Writings tell that this Pokémon was born out of the assembly of five score and eight malevolent spirits.
ZKN_ARCEUS_443_000	It nests in caves untouched by sunlight. Its sharp teeth may fall out when worn away or after an impact, but they regrow within a few days.
ZKN_ARCEUS_444_000	Though Gabite are usually of a violent disposition, when I gave one a glass bead it had been eyeing covetously, it suddenly became quite docile.
ZKN_ARCEUS_445_000	Soars across the heavens at blinding speed—a magnificent sight! It has a feral disposition. Utmost caution is required if one meets a Garchomp out in the wilds.
ZKN_ARCEUS_446_000	Its robust stomach allows it to nonchalantly devour even rotted matter. It pays frequent visits to villages, seeking out food scraps intended for compost.
ZKN_ARCEUS_447_000	Though infantile in appearance, it has the mysterious ability to read the minds of humans. The pure of heart are met with Riolu's approval, while those of ill nature earn only its loathing.
ZKN_ARCEUS_448_000	A most gallant-looking creature. It emits energy waves and controls them with precision, using them to sense even faraway beings. I have given the name "aura" to this power.
ZKN_ARCEUS_449_000	Though large and languid, Hippopotas is difficult to detect due to its tendency to burrow into and lurk beneath the soil. When agitated or excited, it expels sand from its nostrils.
ZKN_ARCEUS_450_000	Short-tempered and easily moved to violence. It whips up whirlwinds of sand to crush its foes' spirits, then goes in for the attack.
ZKN_ARCEUS_451_000	Its claws are not only razor-sharp but poisonous, making Skorupi a highly dangerous Pokémon. It seems to be weakened by cold temperatures, however.
ZKN_ARCEUS_452_000	Has a brutish, ferocious temperament. With immense strength and a sturdy shell off which swords will bounce, it rampages about and wreaks havoc.
ZKN_ARCEUS_453_000	A poison wielder with a dastardly personality. Despite such qualities, this species is afforded a measure of popularity due to its peculiar cry and comical features.
ZKN_ARCEUS_454_000	Its crimson claws contain a virulent toxin. This toxin can be made into a tonic by diluting it, mixing it with several types of wild grass, and boiling it down over two days.
ZKN_ARCEUS_455_000	Though this is a plant Pokémon, it has a gluttonous and unruly temperament. Carnivine attacks its prey with its cavernous maw wide open.
ZKN_ARCEUS_456_000	What a gorgeous sight this Pokémon is as it swims with its long, pink-painted caudal fins fluttering behind it. Finneon's beautiful appearance has led to its nickname: "finery fish."
ZKN_ARCEUS_457_000	Uses its gleaming fins to hunt its prey. The view of Lumineon schooling near the surface of the sea at night is breathtaking— it's as though there were shining stars right there.
ZKN_ARCEUS_458_000	Though ball-like in shape, this Pokémon is a proficient swimmer. I have discovered that if a Mantyke spends much time with schools of Remoraid, it will eventually achieve evolution.
ZKN_ARCEUS_459_000	One is likely to encounter this Pokémon while out in the snow. There are stories of Snover appearing in human settlements but doing no harm—rather, they bond with the children.
ZKN_ARCEUS_460_000	A powerful Pokémon that can split huge boulders with ease. Dislikes associating with others and chooses to live quietly deep within the mountains, playing with the snow.
ZKN_ARCEUS_461_000	This species corners prey as a pack, under the guidance of a leader. Weavile displays increased cunning, leading me to speculate that its evolution caused further brain development.
ZKN_ARCEUS_462_000	I theorize that a special magnetic field influenced this Pokémon, changing its molecular structure and causing it to evolve. It emits strange radio waves toward space from its antenna.
ZKN_ARCEUS_463_000	Its tongue can extend and contract freely, and it is capable of reaching lengths over 10 times Lickilicky's height. Beware of the saliva, as it contains corrosive elements.
ZKN_ARCEUS_464_000	This Pokémon evolved through use of a curious item. Its rocklike hide is composed of a mysterious substance and can withstand a blow from a masterwork sword with nary a scratch.
ZKN_ARCEUS_465_000	Draped with long vines, it resembles a shrub in appearance. It swings bundles of vines as though they were arms, wrapping them around prey to ensnare them.
ZKN_ARCEUS_466_000	Its evolution was induced by an unusual item, and its electrical output rises along with its heart rate. From its tails, it can unleash an electric current measuring 20,000 volts.
ZKN_ARCEUS_467_000	Use of a strange item caused this Pokémon to evolve. Fireballs launched from the ends of its tubelike arms are hot enough to melt an iron pot in an instant.
ZKN_ARCEUS_468_000	Scant few have ever sighted this Pokémon. After studying what literature remains, I am certain Togekiss will reveal itself when peace reigns in the land.
ZKN_ARCEUS_469_000	Extremely violent. When hunting, it wastes none of its energy, aiming only for prey's most vulnerable spots. Any who manage to tame this Pokémon must be of incredible bravery.
ZKN_ARCEUS_470_000	Cells similar to those of plants have been found in its fur. Its hard tail can fell a large tree with one stroke, and the tail's sharpness exceeds even that of a sword crafted by a master.
ZKN_ARCEUS_471_000	Glaceon is able to lower its body temperature very quickly. It freezes the atmosphere, creating diamond dust that glitters like gems while it flutters and dances around.
ZKN_ARCEUS_472_000	It glides soundlessly on pitch-black wings and sinks sharp fangs into the throat of its prey. It takes on a look of satisfaction once it has entirely drained its prey of blood.
ZKN_ARCEUS_473_000	This species reached its zenith during the period known as the ice age. I suspect that Hisui's frigid climate is in harmony with Mamoswine's constitution, thus awakening hidden potential.
ZKN_ARCEUS_474_000	A curious item induced this evolution. The Pokémon's offensive capabilities have greatly increased, but the strangeness of its behavior has magnified in equal measure. This worries me.
ZKN_ARCEUS_475_000	The blades extending from its elbows are sharper than the finest swords. Its swordsmanship, albeit self-taught, is astonishingly impressive.
ZKN_ARCEUS_476_000	It is able to emit powerful magnetism, allowing it control over the iron sand that forms its luscious mustache. Using this iron sand, Probopass forms hard stones with which it smites its prey.
ZKN_ARCEUS_477_000	Comes to those whose lives have come to an end and escorts their souls to the afterlife. Known to mistakenly take the souls of those who yet have life left in them, albeit rarely.
ZKN_ARCEUS_478_000	A Pokémon inhabited by the soul of a woman who died bearing a grudge in the snowy mountains. Legends of Froslass placing deathly curses on misbehaving men send shivers down my spine.
ZKN_ARCEUS_479_000	This bizarre Pokémon appears to be a will-o'-the-wisp powered by electricity. Be wary, as Rotom is both smart and mischievous.
ZKN_ARCEUS_480_000	A Pokémon feared but also respected for stealing away the memories of evildoers. I have found records that suggest Uxie holds dominion over knowledge.
ZKN_ARCEUS_481_000	Known as the Being of Emotion. In legend, this Pokémon was feared, as any who showed disrespect would have their emotions thrown into disarray.
ZKN_ARCEUS_482_000	The dreaded Being of Willpower. Legends tell of this Pokémon manipulating the will of its adversaries and turning them into puppets of its own.
ZKN_ARCEUS_483_000	This Pokémon is revered as a deity in Hisuian legend. The birth of Dialga was what caused the vast river of time to begin flowing in our world.
ZKN_ARCEUS_484_000	This Pokémon is feared as a deity in Hisuian legend. The birth of Palkia was what caused the walls of our world to disappear, creating a sky that spans for infinity.
ZKN_ARCEUS_485_000	Stories tell of this Pokémon being birthed from the boiling magma within Mount Coronet. Its molten-steel body holds many mysteries.
ZKN_ARCEUS_486_000	According to legend, Regigigas pulled landmasses together and bound them with rope to create the continent of Hisui. Though I have my doubts, the story could well contain a shred of truth.
ZKN_ARCEUS_487_000	There is one Hisuian verse that tells of a powerful light creating a deep shadow. I imagine that this deep shadow is Giratina.
ZKN_ARCEUS_488_000	Cresselia is reminiscent of the crescent moon. It leaves a brilliant line of light in its wake as it flies across the night sky. I daresay it resembles the heavenly maiden who created the Milky Way.
ZKN_ARCEUS_489_000	Can be seen floating offshore during seasons when the seas are warm. Its azure body blends in with the ocean waters—logic suggests this is a defense mechanism against natural predators.
ZKN_ARCEUS_490_000	Rumored to migrate across the oceans and visit Hisui's coastal waters only rarely. Although Manaphy resembles Phione, it is also quite different. The relation between the two is unclear.
ZKN_ARCEUS_491_000	On a moonless night, a strange incident occurred in which every one of a village's inhabitants suffered nightmares. The villagers attested that Darkrai appeared before them in these nightmares.
ZKN_ARCEUS_492_000	When the turning of seasons brings the cruel winter to its end and the joyous people give thanks to the heavens, Shaymin appears and covers the withered land with flowers.
ZKN_ARCEUS_493_000	It is the heavenly fount from which pours the light that shines across Hisui. Its luminance guides and protects all Pokémon. Hisuian mythology states that Arceus is the creator of all things.

ZKN_ARCEUS_501_000	This Pokémon from the Unova region uses the shell on its belly as a weapon to cut down its foes. Thus, I've conferred upon this shell the name "scalchop."
ZKN_ARCEUS_502_000	Its exquisite double-scalchop technique is likely the result of daily training, and it can send even masters of the blade fleeing in defeat.

ZKN_ARCEUS_642_000	They say this wielder of electricity has waged war with its nemesis, Tornadus, since time immemorial. The lightning bolts it hurls pierce the very earth and enrich the soil.

ZKN_ARCEUS_899_000	The black orbs shine with an uncanny light when the Pokémon is erecting invisible barriers. The fur shed from its beard retains heat well and is a highly useful material for winter clothing.
ZKN_ARCEUS_900_000	A violent creature that fells towering trees with its crude axes and shields itself with hard stone. If one should chance upon this Pokémon in the wilds, one's only recourse is to flee.
ZKN_ARCEUS_901_000	I believe it was Hisui's swampy terrain that gave Ursaluna its burly physique and newfound capacity to manipulate peat at will.
ZKN_ARCEUS_902_000	Clads itself in the souls of comrades that perished before fulfilling their goals of journeying upstream. No other species throughout all Hisui's rivers is Basculegion's equal.
ZKN_ARCEUS_903_000	Because of Sneasler's virulent poison and daunting physical prowess, no other species could hope to best it on the frozen highlands. Preferring solitude, this species does not form packs.
ZKN_ARCEUS_904_000	Its lancelike spikes and savage temperament have earned it the nickname "sea fiend." It slurps up poison to nourish itself.
ZKN_ARCEUS_905_000	When it flies to this land from across the sea, the bitter winter comes to an end. According to legend, this Pokémon's love gives rise to the budding of fresh life across Hisui.

ZKN_ARCEUS_037_001	These Pokémon live in packs in the snowy mountains and defend themselves with icy breath. I suspect this species changed its form to adapt to the frigid climate.
ZKN_ARCEUS_038_001	Dwells on sacred peaks perpetually covered in snow. Said to appear to virtuous people who have lost their way on mountain paths—it then guides them back down to the mountain's base.

ZKN_ARCEUS_058_001	They patrol their territory in pairs. I believe the igneous rock components in the fur of this species are the result of volcanic activity in its habitat.
ZKN_ARCEUS_059_001	Snaps at its foes with fangs cloaked in blazing flame. Despite its bulk, it deftly feints every which way, leading opponents on a deceptively merry chase as it all but dances around them.

ZKN_ARCEUS_100_001	An enigmatic Pokémon that happens to bear a resemblance to a Poké Ball. When excited, it discharges the electric current it has stored in its belly, then lets out a great, uproarious laugh.
ZKN_ARCEUS_101_001	The tissue on the surface of its body is curiously similar in composition to an Apricorn. When irritated, this Pokémon lets loose an electric current equal to 20 lightning bolts.

ZKN_ARCEUS_157_001	Said to purify lost, forsaken souls with its flames and guide them to the afterlife. I believe its form has been influenced by the energy of the sacred mountain towering at Hisui's center.

ZKN_ARCEUS_212_001	
ZKN_ARCEUS_214_001	
ZKN_ARCEUS_215_001	Its sturdy, curved claws are ideal for traversing precipitous cliffs. From the tips of these claws drips a venom that infiltrates the nerves of any prey caught in Sneasel's grasp.

ZKN_ARCEUS_386_003	
ZKN_ARCEUS_412_001	It creates a cloak by weaving together sand, mud, and silk it has spat out. This earthen cloak is ruined by wind and rain, so the Pokémon hides away in caves and other such places.
ZKN_ARCEUS_412_002	When confronted by a lack of other materials, Burmy will create its cloak using dust and refuse. The cloak seems to be more comfortable than one would think.
ZKN_ARCEUS_413_001	Its earthen skin is reasonably hard—it has no problem repelling a Starly's pecking, at least.
ZKN_ARCEUS_413_002	Its body, composed of refuse, blends in to the scenery so much as to be inconspicuous. This seems to be the perfect way for the Pokémon to evade the detection of predators.
ZKN_ARCEUS_414_001	
ZKN_ARCEUS_414_002	
ZKN_ARCEUS_421_001	Cheerfully active on sunny days. Immediately closes its petals and becomes immobile once the sun becomes hidden, however.
ZKN_ARCEUS_422_001	Found in abundance on seashores bordering cold waters. When pressed upon, the Pokémon will secrete from its body's surface a purple fluid that will stain one's clothes.
ZKN_ARCEUS_423_001	Found more often on the land than in the sea. More active when it's cloudy or rainy out than when the weather is fair.

ZKN_ARCEUS_475_001	
ZKN_ARCEUS_479_001	A form in which Rotom lurks within a strange cauldron. The cauldron's origin is unknown. A bothersome Pokémon, causing trouble with the flames it spits.
ZKN_ARCEUS_479_002	A form in which Rotom lurks within an odd bureau. The bureau's purpose is unknown. A bothersome Pokémon, causing trouble by splashing cold water everywhere.
ZKN_ARCEUS_479_003	A form in which Rotom lurks within a bizarre cupboard. The cupboard's composition is unknown. A bothersome Pokémon, causing trouble by frosting everything over.
ZKN_ARCEUS_479_004	A form in which Rotom lurks within a mysterious contraption. The contraption's purpose is unknown. A bothersome Pokémon, causing trouble by stirring up powerful winds.
ZKN_ARCEUS_479_005	A form in which Rotom lurks within a misshapen wheelbarrow. The wheelbarrow's mechanisms are bizarre. It's a bothersome Pokémon, causing trouble by mowing down grass and trees.
ZKN_ARCEUS_483_001	Radiant light caused Dialga to take on a form bearing a striking resemblance to the creator Pokémon. Dialga now wields such colossal strength that one must conclude this is its true form.
ZKN_ARCEUS_484_001	It soars across the sky in a form that greatly resembles the creator of all things. Perhaps this imitation of appearance is Palkia's strategy for gaining Arceus's powers.
ZKN_ARCEUS_487_001	Giratina loses its legs upon changing into this form. I believe this Pokémon must hail from a world where the heavens and the earth are as one, though I have no way of proving it.
ZKN_ARCEUS_492_001	Upon taking in the scent of a particular rare flower, Shaymin is enveloped in light, and its tiny body transforms. I took a whiff of the flower myself, but alas, my body remained unchanged.
ZKN_ARCEUS_493_001	It is the heavenly fount from which pours the light that shines across Hisui. Its luminance guides and protects all Pokémon. Hisuian mythology states that Arceus is the creator of all things.

ZKN_ARCEUS_503_001	Hard of heart and deft of blade, this rare form of Samurott is a product of the Pokémon's evolution in the region of Hisui. Its turbulent blows crash into foes like ceaseless pounding waves.
ZKN_ARCEUS_521_001	
ZKN_ARCEUS_531_001	
ZKN_ARCEUS_549_001	I suspect that its well-developed legs are the result of a life spent on mountains covered in deep snow. The scent it exudes from its flower crown heartens those in proximity.
ZKN_ARCEUS_549_002	
ZKN_ARCEUS_550_001	
ZKN_ARCEUS_550_002	Though it differs from other Basculin in several respects, including demeanor—this one is gentle—I have categorized it as a regional form given the vast array of shared qualities.

ZKN_ARCEUS_569_999	
ZKN_ARCEUS_570_001	A once-departed soul, returned to life in Hisui. Derives power from resentment, which rises as energy atop its head and takes on the forms of foes. In this way, Zorua vents lingering malice.
ZKN_ARCEUS_571_001	With its disheveled white fur, it looks like an embodiment of death. Heedless of its own safety, Zoroark attacks its nemeses with a bitter energy so intense, it lacerates Zoroark's own body.

ZKN_ARCEUS_628_001	Screaming a bloodcurdling battle cry, this huge and ferocious bird Pokémon goes out on the hunt. It blasts lakes with shock waves, then scoops up any prey that float to the water's surface.
ZKN_ARCEUS_641_001	An example of what is known as a "form change," though I suspect this strange avian guise to be Tornadus's true form. Tornadus has been sighted crossing the ocean while in this form.
ZKN_ARCEUS_642_001	Quick as a flash, it materializes out of nowhere. It pulverizes foes into nothingness with showers of devastatingly powerful lightning bolts launched from the string of orbs on its tail.
ZKN_ARCEUS_645_001	Landorus soars through the sky in this form, bestowing plentiful harvests upon the land and earning the people's reverence. It can traverse the whole of Hisui in a mere couple of hours.

ZKN_LETSGO_009_001	The cannon on its back is as powerful as a tank gun. Its tough legs and back enable it to withstand the recoil from firing the cannon.
ZKN_LETSGO_015_001	Its legs have become poison stingers. It stabs its prey repeatedly with the stingers on its limbs, dealing the final blow with the stinger on its rear.
ZKN_LETSGO_018_001	With its muscular strength now greatly increased, it can fly continuously for two weeks without resting.
ZKN_LETSGO_019_001	Its whiskers provide it with a keen sense of smell, enabling it to pick up the scent of hidden food and locate it instantly.

ZKN_LETSGO_026_001	It loves pancakes prepared with a secret Alolan recipe. Some wonder whether that recipe holds the key to this Pokémon's evolution.
ZKN_LETSGO_027_001	Its ice-covered body lets it slide across the ground with bullet-like speed, sending its enemies flying when it hits them.
ZKN_LETSGO_028_001	This is Sandslash's form after adaptation to a frigid environment. The cold air emitted by its body sharpens its icy spikes.
ZKN_LETSGO_037_001	It looks like snow come to life, and the breath it exhales is −58 degrees Fahrenheit. Another name for it is Keokeo.
ZKN_LETSGO_038_001	It lives on mountains perpetually covered in snow and is revered as a deity incarnate. It appears draped in a blizzard.
ZKN_LETSGO_050_001	After living in soil with high iron content for some time, three steel whiskers sprouted from the top of its head.
ZKN_LETSGO_051_001	They’re referred to as triplets, but they’re not identical—the metallic elements in their bodies differ slightly. The proof shows in their whiskers!
ZKN_LETSGO_052_001	Highly intelligent and prideful, it's famously difficult to handle—but that's also a reason for its popularity.
ZKN_LETSGO_053_001	It has the classiest coat. The rippling of its fur in the heat of battle has a beauty all its own.
ZKN_LETSGO_065_001	It's adept at precognition. When attacks completely miss Alakazam, that's because it's seeing the future.
ZKN_LETSGO_074_001	Its stone head is imbued with electricity and magnetism. If you carelessly step on one, you'll be in for a painful shock.
ZKN_LETSGO_075_001	When it comes rolling down a mountain path, anything in its way gets zapped by electricity and sent flying.
ZKN_LETSGO_076_001	It uses magnetism to accelerate and fire off rocks tinged with electricity. Even if it doesn't score a direct hit, the jolt of electricity will do the job.
ZKN_LETSGO_080_001	Under the influence of Shellder's digestive fluids, Slowpoke has awakened, gaining a great deal of power—and a little motivation to boot.
ZKN_LETSGO_088_001	It has a passion for trash above all else, speedily digesting it and creating brilliant crystals of sparkling poison.
ZKN_LETSGO_089_001	Muk's coloration becomes increasingly vivid the more it feasts on its favorite dish—trash.
ZKN_LETSGO_094_001	It can pass through other dimensions and appear anywhere. It caused a stir one time when it stuck just one leg out of a wall.
ZKN_LETSGO_103_001	The strong sunlight of the Alola region has awakened the power hidden within Exeggcute. This is the result.
ZKN_LETSGO_105_001	It has transformed the spirit of its dear departed mother into flames, and tonight it will once again dance in mourning of others of its kind.
ZKN_LETSGO_105_002	
ZKN_LETSGO_115_001	Its child has grown rapidly, thanks to the energy of Mega Evolution. Mother and child show off their harmonious teamwork in battle.
ZKN_LETSGO_127_001	With its vaunted horns, it can lift an opponent 10 times heavier than itself and fly about with ease.
ZKN_LETSGO_130_001	Although it obeys its instinctive drive to destroy everything within its reach, it will respond to orders from a Trainer it truly trusts.
ZKN_LETSGO_133_001	
ZKN_LETSGO_142_001	The power of Mega Evolution has completely restored its genes. The rocks on its body are harder than diamond.
ZKN_LETSGO_150_001	Psychic power has augmented its muscles. It has a grip strength of one ton and can sprint a hundred meters in two seconds flat!
ZKN_LETSGO_150_002	Despite its diminished size, its mental power has grown phenomenally. With a mere thought, it can smash a skyscraper to smithereens.

ZKN_MOON_009_000	
ZKN_MOON_010_000	It's easy to catch, and it grows quickly, making it one of the top recommendations for novice Pokémon Trainers.
ZKN_MOON_011_000	Its shell is hard, but it's still just a bug shell. It's been known to break, so intense battles with it should be avoided.
ZKN_MOON_012_000	When attacked by other Pokémon, it defends itself by scattering its poisonous scales and fluttering its wings.
ZKN_MOON_013_000	
ZKN_MOON_014_000	
ZKN_MOON_015_000	
ZKN_MOON_016_000	
ZKN_MOON_017_000	
ZKN_MOON_018_000	
ZKN_MOON_019_000	With their strong capacity for survival, they can live in dirty places without concern. Left unchecked, their numbers multiply rapidly.
ZKN_MOON_020_000	Its disposition is far more violent than its looks would suggest. Don't let your hand get too close to its face, as it could bite your hand clean off.
ZKN_MOON_021_000	Farmers whose fields are troubled by bug Pokémon appreciate Spearow for its vigorous appetite and look after it.
ZKN_MOON_022_000	Drawings of a Pokémon resembling Fearow can be seen in murals from deep in ancient history.
ZKN_MOON_023_000	
ZKN_MOON_024_000	
ZKN_MOON_025_000	It's in its nature to store electricity. It feels stressed now and then if it's unable to fully discharge the electricity.
ZKN_MOON_026_000	It becomes aggressive when it has electricity stored up. At such times, even its Trainer has to take care to avoid being attacked.
ZKN_MOON_027_000	It usually makes its home in deserts and arid zones, where rain does not fall. It digs holes to catch Bug-type Pokémon.
ZKN_MOON_028_000	It uses its claws to climb trees and then curls its body into a spiny ball, ready to drop onto any prey that appears.
ZKN_MOON_029_000	
ZKN_MOON_030_000	
ZKN_MOON_031_000	
ZKN_MOON_032_000	
ZKN_MOON_033_000	
ZKN_MOON_034_000	
ZKN_MOON_035_000	On nights with a full moon, they gather together and dance. The surrounding area is enveloped in an abnormal magnetic field.
ZKN_MOON_036_000	According to tradition, people who see a pair of Clefable skipping by can look forward to a happy marriage.
ZKN_MOON_037_000	From its mouth spew flames that seem to resemble the spirits of the deceased. Some people mistakenly think this fire is a ghost.
ZKN_MOON_038_000	Said to live for a thousand years, this Pokémon uses its supernatural abilities to manipulate fire. It can burn its prey to a crisp as it pleases.
ZKN_MOON_039_000	Jigglypuff possess a vocal range that exceeds 12 octaves, but each individual's singing skill depends on its own effort.
ZKN_MOON_040_000	As it inhales, it expands...and expands...and expands. Wigglytuff compete to see which one can inflate itself the most.
ZKN_MOON_041_000	When exposed to sunlight, they suffer burns. The frequency of their ultrasonic waves can differ slightly from colony to colony.
ZKN_MOON_042_000	Sometimes they drink so much blood, they can't fly anymore. Then they fall to the ground and become food for other Pokémon.
ZKN_MOON_043_000	
ZKN_MOON_044_000	
ZKN_MOON_045_000	
ZKN_MOON_046_000	Mushrooms called tochukaso sprout from its back. They can be dried and powdered to make a medicine used to extend life.
ZKN_MOON_047_000	It scatters toxic spores from its mushroom cap. Once harvested, these spores can be steeped and boiled down to prepare herbal medicines.
ZKN_MOON_048_000	
ZKN_MOON_049_000	
ZKN_MOON_050_000	Many farmers cherish and nurture Diglett because its droppings enrich the soil it lives in.
ZKN_MOON_051_000	Despite the closeness between this Pokémon and farmers and other people, no one has ever seen the parts of it concealed underground.
ZKN_MOON_052_000	It loves shiny things. It often fights with Murkrow over prey they're both trying to catch.
ZKN_MOON_053_000	It has a high opinion of itself, although not to the same extent as the Alolan Persian. It's quite difficult to make friends with this Pokémon.
ZKN_MOON_054_000	This Pokémon is troubled by constant headaches. The more pain it’s in, the more powerful its psychokinesis becomes.
ZKN_MOON_055_000	It swims along the banks of lakes and catches fish Pokémon. It takes them to the shore and quietly eats them up.
ZKN_MOON_056_000	Its raging tires it out and causes it to fall asleep, but the anger resonating in its dreams causes it to wake up—which infuriates it all over again.
ZKN_MOON_057_000	Some researchers theorize that Primeape remains angry even when inside a Poké Ball.
ZKN_MOON_058_000	It looks cute, but when you approach another Trainer’s Growlithe, it will bark at you and bite.
ZKN_MOON_059_000	The fire burning inside its body serves as the energy to fuel it as it runs great distances. It appears in many legends.
ZKN_MOON_060_000	It’s still not very good at walking. Its Trainers should train this Pokémon to walk every day.
ZKN_MOON_061_000	It marches over the land in search of bug Pokémon to eat. Then it takes them underwater so it can dine on them where it’s safe.
ZKN_MOON_062_000	Its percentage of body fat is nearly zero. Its body is entirely muscle, which makes it heavy and forces its swimming prowess to develop.
ZKN_MOON_063_000	It can teleport itself to safety while it’s asleep, but when it wakes, it doesn’t know where it is, so it panics.
ZKN_MOON_064_000	Kadabra’s presence infests televisions and monitors with creepy shadows that bring bad luck.
ZKN_MOON_065_000	Its brain cells continue to increase in number until its death. The older the Alakazam, the larger its head.
ZKN_MOON_066_000	With its superhuman strength, it’s able to throw a hundred people all at the same time. Its strength comes from lifting Graveler every day.
ZKN_MOON_067_000	It willingly assists with hard labor because it knows the work is good training for its muscles.
ZKN_MOON_068_000	It can lift heavy loads with the greatest of ease. It can even heft dump trucks. But its clumsy fingers prevent it from doing any precision work.
ZKN_MOON_069_000	
ZKN_MOON_070_000	
ZKN_MOON_071_000	
ZKN_MOON_072_000	It drifts in shallow seas, such as the areas near beaches. If you get bitten or stabbed by its toxic tentacles, rush to the hospital.
ZKN_MOON_073_000	Although these Pokémon are rare, when a large outbreak of them occurs, all fish Pokémon disappear from the surrounding sea.
ZKN_MOON_074_000	There are plenty of them to be found along any road. A scholar with too much free time once counted a hundred of them along a single route.
ZKN_MOON_075_000	This slow-footed Pokémon moves by curling up and rolling instead of walking. With enough momentum, its speed can exceed 60 mph.
ZKN_MOON_076_000	Once a year, this Pokémon molts, and its shed shell returns to the soil. This process creates enriched soil, so farmers collect the shells.
ZKN_MOON_077_000	
ZKN_MOON_078_000	
ZKN_MOON_079_000	Alolan home cooking involves drying Slowpoke tails and then simmering them into a salty stew.
ZKN_MOON_080_000	Whenever Shellder bites down hard on its tail, it gives Slowbro a flash of inspiration...which it forgets a moment later.
ZKN_MOON_081_000	It sends out electromagnetic waves, which let it float through the air. Touching it while it’s eating electricity will give you a full-body shock.
ZKN_MOON_082_000	It has about three times the electrical power of Magnemite. For some reason, outbreaks of this Pokémon happen when lots of sunspots appear.
ZKN_MOON_083_000	
ZKN_MOON_084_000	
ZKN_MOON_085_000	
ZKN_MOON_086_000	
ZKN_MOON_087_000

ZKN_OMEGA_001_000	Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight. There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger.
ZKN_OMEGA_002_000	There is a bud on this Pokémon's back. To support its weight, Ivysaur's legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight, it's a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.
ZKN_OMEGA_003_000	There is a large flower on Venusaur's back. The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people.
ZKN_OMEGA_004_000	The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is enjoying itself. If the Pokémon becomes enraged, the flame burns fiercely.
ZKN_OMEGA_005_000	Charmeleon mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp claws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive. In this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with a bluish white color.
ZKN_OMEGA_006_000	Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.

ZKN_OMEGA_011_000	The shell covering this Pokémon's body is as hard as an iron slab. Metapod does not move very much. It stays still because it is preparing its soft innards for evolution inside the hard shell.
ZKN_OMEGA_012_000	Butterfree has a superior ability to search for delicious honey from flowers. It can even search out, extract, and carry honey from flowers that are blooming over six miles from its nest.
ZKN_OMEGA_013_000	Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable of distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose).
ZKN_OMEGA_014_000	Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares for its coming evolution. This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch.
ZKN_OMEGA_015_000	Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach its nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack in a furious swarm.

ZKN_OMEGA_025_000	Whenever Pikachu comes across something new, it blasts it with a jolt of electricity. If you come across a blackened berry, it's evidence that this Pokémon mistook the intensity of its charge.

ZKN_OMEGA_045_000	Vileplume's toxic pollen triggers atrocious allergy attacks. That's why it is advisable never to approach any attractive flowers in a jungle, however pretty they may be.

ZKN_OMEGA_055_000	The webbed flippers on its forelegs and hind legs and the streamlined body of Golduck give it frightening speed. This Pokémon is definitely much faster than even the most athletic swimmer.
ZKN_OMEGA_056_000	When Mankey starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns rough, it's a sure sign that it is becoming angry. However, because it goes into a towering rage almost instantly, it is impossible for anyone to flee its wrath.

ZKN_OMEGA_065_000	Alakazam's brain continually grows, making its head far too heavy to support with its neck. This Pokémon holds its head up using its psychokinetic power instead.

ZKN_OMEGA_073_000	Tentacruel has large red orbs on its head. The orbs glow before lashing the vicinity with a harsh ultrasonic blast. This Pokémon's outburst creates rough waves around it.

ZKN_OMEGA_079_000	Slowpoke uses its tail to catch prey by dipping it in water at the side of a river. However, this Pokémon often forgets what it's doing and often spends entire days just loafing at water's edge.
ZKN_OMEGA_080_000	Slowbro's tail has a Shellder firmly attached with a bite. As a result, the tail can't be used for fishing anymore. This causes Slowbro to grudgingly swim and catch prey instead.

ZKN_OMEGA_084_000	Doduo's two heads never sleep at the same time. Its two heads take turns sleeping, so one head can always keep watch for enemies while the other one sleeps.
ZKN_OMEGA_085_000	Watch out if Dodrio's three heads are looking in three separate directions. It's a sure sign that it is on its guard. Don't go near this Pokémon if it's being wary—it may decide to peck you.

ZKN_SHIELD_420_000	The deeper a Cherubi's red, the more nutrients it has stockpiled in its body. And the sweeter and tastier its small ball!

ZKN_SHIELD_422_000	Subjecting this Pokémon to a strong force causes it to secrete a strange purple fluid. Though harmless, the fluid is awfully sticky.

ZKN_SHIELD_436_000	Polishing Bronzor to a shine makes its surface reflect the truth, according to common lore. Be that as it may, Bronzor hates being polished.

ZKN_SHIELD_447_000	It can use waves called auras to gauge how others are feeling. These same waves can also tell this Pokémon about the state of the environment.
ZKN_SHIELD_448_000	It can tell what people are thinking. Only Trainers who have justice in their hearts can earn this Pokémon's trust.
ZKN_SHIELD_449_000	This Pokémon is active during the day and passes the cold desert nights burrowed snugly into the sand.

ZKN_SHIELD_458_000	It swims along with a school of Remoraid, and they'll all fight together to repel attackers.
ZKN_SHIELD_459_000	The berries that grow around its belly are like ice pops. Galarian Darumaka absolutely love these berries.

ZKN_SHIELD_516_000	
ZKN_SHIELD_517_000	It eats dreams and releases mist. The mist is pink when it's eating a good dream, and black when it's eating a nightmare.
ZKN_SHIELD_518_000	It drowses and dreams all the time. It's best to leave it be if it's just woken up, as it's a terrible grump when freshly roused from sleep.
ZKN_SHIELD_519_000	It's forgetful and not very bright, but many Trainers love it anyway for its friendliness and sincerity.
ZKN_SHIELD_520_000	These bright Pokémon have acute memories. Apparently delivery workers often choose them as their partners.

ZKN_SHIELD_532_000	Timburr that have started carrying logs that are about three times their size are nearly ready to evolve.
ZKN_SHIELD_533_000	Gurdurr excels at demolition—construction is not its forte. In any case, there's skill in the way this Pokémon wields its metal beam.

ZKN_SHIELD_541_000

ZKN_SHIELD_549_000	Essential oils made from Lilligant flowers have a sublime scent, but they're also staggeringly expensive.

ZKN_SHIELD_570_000	Zorua sometimes transforms into a person and goes into cities to search for food. When Zorua does this, it usually takes on the form of a child.
ZKN_SHIELD_571_000	Seeking to ease the burden of their solitude, lonely Trainers tell Zoroark to show illusions to them.
ZKN_SHIELD_572_000	They pet each other with their tails as a form of greeting. Of the two, the one whose tail is fluffier is a bit more boastful.
ZKN_SHIELD_573_000	A special oil that seeps through their fur helps them avoid attacks. The oil fetches a high price at market.
ZKN_SHIELD_574_000	Even when nobody seems to be around, Gothita can still be heard making a muted cry. Many believe it's speaking to something only it can see.

ZKN_SWORD_590_000	No one knows what the Poké Ball–like pattern on Foongus means or why Foongus has it.

ZKN_SWORD_603_000

ZKN_SWORD_615_000	With its icy chains, Cryogonal freezes those it encounters. It then takes its victims away to somewhere unknown.

ZKN_SWORD_617_000	It moves with blinding speed and lobs poison at foes. Featuring Accelgor as a main character is a surefire way to make a movie or comic popular.

ZKN_SWORD_676_000	
ZKN_SWORD_677_000	Though Espurr's expression never changes, behind that blank stare is an intense struggle to contain its devastating psychic power.

ZKN_SWORD_724_000	As if wielding a bow, it launches the arrow quills hidden among the feathers of its wings. Decidueye's shots never miss.
ZKN_SWORD_725_000	It spends even the smallest amount of downtime grooming its fur with its tongue. Loose fur gathers in its stomach and serves as fuel for fiery moves.

ZKN_SWORD_734_000	
ZKN_SWORD_735_000	
ZKN_SWORD_736_000	Its natural enemies, like Rookidee, may flee rather than risk getting caught in its large mandibles that can snap thick tree branches.
ZKN_SWORD_737_000	While its durable shell protects it from attacks, Charjabug strikes at enemies with jolts of electricity discharged from the tips of its jaws.
ZKN_SWORD_738_000	It builds up electricity in its abdomen, focuses it through its jaws, and then fires the electricity off in concentrated beams.

ZKN_SWORD_740_000	
ZKN_SWORD_741_000	
ZKN_SWORD_742_000	Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. You can find Cutiefly hovering around Gossifleur, trying to get some of Gossifleur's pollen.

ZKN_SWORD_745_000	This Lycanroc is calm and cautious. The rocks jutting from its mane are razor sharp.

ZKN_SWORD_747_000	The first symptom of its sting is numbness. The next is an itching sensation so intense that it's impossible to resist the urge to claw at your skin.
ZKN_SWORD_748_000	To survive in the cold waters of Galar, this Pokémon forms a dome with its legs, enclosing its body so it can capture its own body heat.
ZKN_SWORD_749_000	Loads weighing up to 50 times as much as its own body weight pose no issue for this Pokémon. It's skilled at making use of mud.
ZKN_SWORD_750_000	Mud that hardens around a Mudsdale's legs sets harder than stone. It's so hard that it allows this Pokémon to scrap a truck with a single kick.
ZKN_SWORD_751_000	It forms a water bubble at the rear of its body and then covers its head with it. Meeting another Dewpider means comparing water-bubble sizes.

ZKN_SWORD_761_000	Its body gives off a sweet, fruity scent that is extremely appetizing to bird Pokémon.

ZKN_SWORD_774_000	
ZKN_SWORD_775_000	
ZKN_SWORD_776_000	Explosive substances coat the shell on its back. Enemies that dare attack it will be blown away by an immense detonation.
ZKN_SWORD_777_000	With the long hairs on its back, this Pokémon takes in electricity from other electric Pokémon. It stores what it absorbs in an electric sac.
ZKN_SWORD_778_000	It wears a rag fashioned into a Pikachu costume in an effort to look less scary. Unfortunately, the costume only makes it creepier.
ZKN_SWORD_779_000	
ZKN_SWORD_780_000	The mountains it calls home are nearly two miles in height. On rare occasions, it descends to play with the children living in the towns below.

ZKN_SWORD_807_000	It runs as fast as lightning strikes, shredding its opponents with its high-voltage claws.
ZKN_SWORD_808_000	It dissolves and eats metal. Circulating liquid metal within its body is how it generates energy.
ZKN_SWORD_809_000	At the end of its life-span, Melmetal will rust and fall apart. The small shards left behind will eventually be reborn as Meltan.
ZKN_SWORD_810_000	When it uses its special stick to strike up a beat, the sound waves produced carry revitalizing energy to the plants and flowers in the area.
ZKN_SWORD_811_000	The faster a Thwackey can beat out a rhythm with its two sticks, the more respect it wins from its peers.
ZKN_SWORD_812_000	By drumming, it taps into the power of its special tree stump. The roots of the stump follow its direction in battle.

ZKN_SWORD_815_000	It juggles a pebble with its feet, turning it into a burning soccer ball. Its shots strike opponents hard and leave them scorched.

ZKN_SWORD_819_000	Found throughout the Galar region, this Pokémon becomes uneasy if its cheeks are ever completely empty of berries.
ZKN_SWORD_820_000	It stashes berries in its tail—so many berries that they fall out constantly. But this Pokémon is a bit slow-witted, so it doesn't notice the loss.
ZKN_SWORD_821_000	It will bravely challenge any opponent, no matter how powerful. This Pokémon benefits from every battle—even a defeat increases its strength a bit.

ZKN_SWORD_823_000	This Pokémon reigns supreme in the skies of the Galar region. The black luster of its steel body could drive terror into the heart of any foe.
ZKN_SWORD_824_000	A constant collector of information, this Pokémon is very smart. Very strong is what it isn't.

ZKN_SWORD_827_000	Aided by the soft pads on its feet, it silently raids the food stores of other Pokémon. It survives off its ill-gotten gains.

ZKN_SWORD_829_000	It anchors itself in the ground with its single leg, then basks in the sun. After absorbing enough sunlight, its petals spread as it blooms brilliantly.
ZKN_SWORD_830_000	The seeds attached to its cotton fluff are full of nutrients. It spreads them on the wind so that plants and other Pokémon can benefit from them.
ZKN_SWORD_831_000	Its curly fleece is such an effective cushion that this Pokémon could fall off a cliff and stand right back up at the bottom, unharmed.
ZKN_SWORD_832_000	Weave a carpet from its springy wool, and you end up with something closer to a trampoline. You'll start to bounce the moment you set foot on it.
ZKN_SWORD_833_000	Apparently the itch of its teething impels it to snap its jaws at anything in front of it.
ZKN_SWORD_834_000	With jaws that can shear through steel rods, this highly aggressive Pokémon chomps down on its unfortunate prey.

ZKN_SWORD_839_000	It's usually peaceful, but the vandalism of mines enrages it. Offenders will be incinerated with flames that reach 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit.
ZKN_SWORD_840_000	It spends its entire life inside an apple. It hides from its natural enemies, bird Pokémon, by pretending it's just an apple and nothing more.
ZKN_SWORD_841_000	It ate a sour apple, and that induced its evolution. In its cheeks, it stores an acid capable of causing chemical burns.
ZKN_SWORD_842_000	Eating a sweet apple caused its evolution. A nectarous scent wafts from its body, luring in the bug Pokémon it preys on.
ZKN_SWORD_843_000	As it digs, it swallows sand and stores it in its neck pouch. The pouch can hold more than 17 pounds of sand.
ZKN_SWORD_844_000	When it contracts its body, over 220 pounds of sand sprays from its nose. If it ever runs out of sand, it becomes disheartened.
ZKN_SWORD_845_000	It's so strong that it can knock out some opponents in a single hit, but it also may forget what it's battling midfight.
ZKN_SWORD_846_000	If it sees any movement around it, this Pokémon charges for it straightaway, leading with its sharply pointed jaw. It's very proud of that jaw.

ZKN_SWORD_852_000	It's very curious, but its means of investigating things is to try to punch them with its tentacles. The search for food is what brings it onto land.
ZKN_SWORD_853_000	A body made up of nothing but muscle makes the grappling moves this Pokémon performs with its tentacles tremendously powerful.
ZKN_SWORD_854_000	This Pokémon is said to have been born when a lonely spirit possessed a cold, leftover cup of tea.
ZKN_SWORD_855_000	This species lives in antique teapots. Most pots are forgeries, but on rare occasions, an authentic work is found.
ZKN_SWORD_856_000	Via the protrusion on its head, it senses other creatures' emotions. If you don't have a calm disposition, it will never warm up to you.
ZKN_SWORD_857_000	No matter who you are, if you bring strong emotions near this Pokémon, it will silence you violently.
ZKN_SWORD_858_000	It emits psychic power strong enough to cause headaches as a deterrent to the approach of others.
ZKN_SWORD_859_000	Through its nose, it sucks in the emanations produced by people and Pokémon when they feel annoyed. It thrives off this negative energy.
ZKN_SWORD_860_000	When it gets down on all fours as if to beg for forgiveness, it's trying to lure opponents in so that it can stab them with its spear-like hair.
ZKN_SWORD_861_000	With the hair wrapped around its body helping to enhance its muscles, this Pokémon can overwhelm even Machamp.
ZKN_SWORD_862_000	Its voice is staggering in volume. Obstagoon has a tendency to take on a threatening posture and shout—this move is known as Obstruct.
ZKN_SWORD_863_000	What appears to be an iron helmet is actually hardened hair. This Pokémon lives for the thrill of battle.
ZKN_SWORD_864_000	Its shell is overflowing with its heightened otherworldly energy. The ectoplasm serves as protection for this Pokémon's core spirit.

ZKN_SWORD_876_000	It uses the horns on its head to sense the emotions of others. Males will act as valets for those they serve, looking after their every need.
ZKN_SWORD_877_000	As it eats the seeds stored up in its pocket-like pouches, this Pokémon is not just satisfying its constant hunger. It's also generating electricity.

ZKN_SWORD_881_000	The shaking of its freezing upper half is what generates its electricity. It has a hard time walking around.
ZKN_SWORD_882_000	Powerful legs and jaws made it the apex predator of its time. Its own overhunting of its prey was what drove it to extinction.
ZKN_SWORD_883_000	Though it's able to capture prey by freezing its surroundings, it has trouble eating the prey afterward because its mouth is on top of its head.
ZKN_SWORD_884_000	Its body resembles polished metal, and it's both lightweight and strong. The only drawback is that it rusts easily.
ZKN_SWORD_885_000	After being reborn as a ghost Pokémon, Dreepy wanders the areas it used to inhabit back when it was alive in prehistoric seas.

ZKN_SWORD_887_000	When it isn't battling, it keeps Dreepy in the holes on its horns. Once a fight starts, it launches the Dreepy like supersonic missiles.

ZKN_SWORD_891_000	Kubfu trains hard to perfect its moves. The moves it masters will determine which form it takes when it evolves.

ZKN_SWORD_009_001	
ZKN_SWORD_009_999	It's not very good at precision shooting. When attacking, it just fires its 31 cannons over and over and over.
ZKN_SWORD_012_999	Crystallized Gigantamax energy makes up this Pokémon's blindingly bright and highly toxic scales.

ZKN_ULMOON_009_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_010_000	Its body is soft and weak. In nature, its perpetual fate is to be seen by others as food.
ZKN_ULMOON_011_000	Its hard shell doesn't crack a bit even if Pikipek pecks at it, but it will tip over, spilling out its insides.
ZKN_ULMOON_012_000	Nectar from pretty flowers is its favorite food. In fields of flowers, it has heated battles with Cutiefly for territory.

ZKN_ULMOON_015_000

ZKN_ULMOON_017_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_018_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_019_000	This Pokémon is common but hazardous. Its sharp incisors can easily cut right through hard wood.
ZKN_ULMOON_020_000	Its whiskers are essential for maintaining its balance. No matter how friendly you are, it will get angry and bite you if you touch its whiskers.
ZKN_ULMOON_021_000	Due to its short wings, it can't fly long distances. It wanders about restlessly and pecks at bug Pokémon.
ZKN_ULMOON_022_000	In Alola, fish Pokémon are its prey. It can be seen circling above the ocean searching for food.
ZKN_ULMOON_023_000	The eggs of bird Pokémon are its favorite food. It swallows eggs whole, so sometimes an egg gets stuck, and Ekans faints.
ZKN_ULMOON_024_000	After stunning its opponents with the pattern on its stomach, it quickly wraps them up in its body and waits for them to stop moving.
ZKN_ULMOON_025_000	While sleeping, it generates electricity in the sacs in its cheeks. If it's not getting enough sleep, it will be able to use only weak electricity.
ZKN_ULMOON_026_000	Because so many Trainers like the way Pikachu looks, you don't see this Pokémon very often.
ZKN_ULMOON_027_000	When its skin gets wrinkled from moisture, it heads for a volcano. It lies flat on a spot with a lot of geothermal heat and dries itself out.
ZKN_ULMOON_028_000	Thanks to its thick claws, it's good at climbing trees. There are plenty of Sandslash that park themselves in trees and go right to sleep.
ZKN_ULMOON_029_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_030_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_031_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_032_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_033_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_034_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_035_000	Bathed in moonlight, its wings glow faintly. Without even flapping, Clefairy rises into the air, where it dances around.
ZKN_ULMOON_036_000	Some scientists believe that it gazes intently at the sky on nights with a full moon because it's homesick.
ZKN_ULMOON_037_000	It manipulates balls of fire to catch its prey. If you raise one from when it's young, it will grow close to you like a puppy Pokémon.
ZKN_ULMOON_038_000	The flickering flames it spews from its mouth leave its opponents hypnotized. Then, this extremely intelligent Pokémon attacks.
ZKN_ULMOON_039_000	The songs they sing are totally different depending on the region they live in. Some even sound like they're shouting!
ZKN_ULMOON_040_000	When it gets angry, it inhales with all its might, and its body gradually inflates. Sometimes they can grow 20 times larger!
ZKN_ULMOON_041_000	Their skin is so thin that they'll be burned if sunlight hits them. When it gets cold out, they gather together to warm one another's bodies.
ZKN_ULMOON_042_000	They can suck down over 10 ounces of blood in one go. They have been known to drink so much blood that they can no longer fly.
ZKN_ULMOON_043_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_044_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_045_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_046_000	The mushrooms, known as tochukaso, are controlling the bug. Even if the bug bugs the mushrooms, they tell it to bug off.
ZKN_ULMOON_047_000	Its poisonous spores are also used in traditional medicine. Apparently, spores produced in Alola are not of very good quality.
ZKN_ULMOON_048_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_049_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_050_000	Around their crops, farmers plant the kind of tree that Diglett like to eat as a way of getting Diglett to plow the fields for them.
ZKN_ULMOON_051_000	Dugtrio's heads are sleek and smooth and incredibly hard. It can dig through any soil with its headbutts.
ZKN_ULMOON_052_000	It loves coins, so if you give it one, you can make friends with Meowth easily. But it's fickle, so you can't count on that friendship lasting.
ZKN_ULMOON_053_000	This Pokémon is popular with rich people. It's also targeted by hunters who are after the jewel in its forehead.
ZKN_ULMOON_054_000	It has been found that its brain cells are 10 times more active when Psyduck is experiencing a headache.
ZKN_ULMOON_055_000	A professional swimmer, it can continue swimming for two days straight by waving its long tail skillfully.
ZKN_ULMOON_056_000	If one gets angry, all the others around it will get angry, so silence is a rare visitor in a troop of Mankey.
ZKN_ULMOON_057_000	The blood vessels in its brain are sturdier than those of other Pokémon, so it can stay healthy despite its constant raging.
ZKN_ULMOON_058_000	It has lived alongside humans since ages ago. Its bones have been found in excavations of ruins from the Stone Age.
ZKN_ULMOON_059_000	There are so many old tales about them that they're called legendary Pokémon, but there are way more of them around than you'd expect.
ZKN_ULMOON_060_000	The direction of the swirl on their stomachs differs depending on where they live. Poliwag aficionados can tell them apart at a glance.
ZKN_ULMOON_061_000	Its health suffers when its skin dries out, so be sure to moisturize it diligently.
ZKN_ULMOON_062_000	The muscles it has developed through swimming are thick and powerful. When it lands a square punch, it can turn huge boulders to dust.
ZKN_ULMOON_063_000	It can read others' minds and will teleport away when danger approaches. You must clear your mind if you want to catch it.
ZKN_ULMOON_064_000	It possesses strong mental capabilities, but its psychic powers are halved when it's not holding a silver spoon.
ZKN_ULMOON_065_000	If it trusts someone deeply, it will let them have one of its spoons. Anything you eat with that spoon is apparently delicious.
ZKN_ULMOON_066_000	It likes food that's highly nutritious because its instincts drive it to build muscle efficiently.
ZKN_ULMOON_067_000	A popular motif for sculptures, its incredibly well-developed muscles have captured the imagination of many an artist.
ZKN_ULMOON_068_000	With four arms, it can attack and defend simultaneously. It's said to have mastered every martial art in the world.
ZKN_ULMOON_069_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_070_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_071_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_072_000	Its body is 99% water. The remaining 1% contains the organ that makes its poison.
ZKN_ULMOON_073_000	It communicates with others of its kind by lighting up the red orbs on its head. When the orbs are blinking, it's a warning sign.
ZKN_ULMOON_074_000	It uses both hands to climb precipitous cliffs. People who see it in action have been known to take up bouldering.
ZKN_ULMOON_075_000	It travels by rolling down cliffs. If it falls into a river, it will explode with its last gasp.
ZKN_ULMOON_076_000	It detonates its own body. The power from that explosion can propel it up steep mountain paths with amazing speed.
ZKN_ULMOON_077_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_078_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_079_000	Although their tails, which fall off naturally, can easily be found lying around, they're a precious ingredient for cooking.
ZKN_ULMOON_080_000	Shellder, in its greed to suck out more and more sweetness from Slowbro's tail, has metamorphosed into a spiral-shaped shell.
ZKN_ULMOON_081_000	Perhaps because electrical lines are often buried these days, the number of Magnemite attacks on power plants has increased.
ZKN_ULMOON_082_000	When rain clouds form, many Magneton gather in high places to wait for lightning to strike.
ZKN_ULMOON_083_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_084_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_085_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_086_000	Thanks to its thick fat, cold seas don't bother it at all, but it gets tired pretty easily in warm waters.
ZKN_ULMOON_087_000	It sunbathes on the beach after meals. The rise in its body temperature helps its digestion.
ZKN_ULMOON_088_000	The wastewater coming from factories is clean these days, so Grimer have nothing to eat. They're said to be on the verge of extinction.
ZKN_ULMOON_089_000	Because they scatter germs everywhere, they've long been targeted for extermination, leading to a steep decline in their population.
ZKN_ULMOON_090_000	Even when its shell is closed, its tongue still hangs out. If you give its tongue a good yank, the shock will cause Shellder to open its shell.
ZKN_ULMOON_091_000	Slowpoke tails are its favorite food. It has even been known to come up on land to look for Slowpoke from time to time.
ZKN_ULMOON_092_000	Poisonous gas comprises 95% of its body. It's said that the remaining 5% is made up of the souls of those who died from the gas.
ZKN_ULMOON_093_000	It's dangerous to go outside alone on nights when you're feeling sad. Haunter will catch you, and you won't be able to go back home.
ZKN_ULMOON_094_000	Even your home isn't safe. Gengar will lurk in whatever dark corner of a room it can find and wait for its chance to catch its prey.
ZKN_ULMOON_095_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_096_000	It puts its prey to sleep and devours their dreams. It seems that bad dreams taste sour, so Drowzee doesn't particularly like eating them.
ZKN_ULMOON_097_000	There are some Hypno that assist doctors with patients who can't sleep at night in hospitals.
ZKN_ULMOON_098_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_099_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_100_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_101_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_102_000	Although they are the same size as other Exeggcute, the ones produced in Alola are quite heavy. Their shells are packed full.
ZKN_ULMOON_103_000	Each of its three heads has its own thoughts. When they want to go in different directions, Exeggutor becomes unable to move.
ZKN_ULMOON_104_000	It wears its mother's skull on its head, so no one knows what its bare face looks like. However, it's clear that it's always crying.
ZKN_ULMOON_105_000	They thump their bones rhythmically to communicate among themselves. There are nearly 50 different rhythmic patterns.
ZKN_ULMOON_106_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_107_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_108_000	It licks filth clean with its tongue. Whatever it licks always stinks afterward, so whether it's really clean is...questionable.
ZKN_ULMOON_109_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_110_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_111_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_112_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_113_000	Because the eggs on their bellies have been overharvested by people in the past, the Chansey population remains very small.
ZKN_ULMOON_114_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_115_000	You shouldn't get close to the child when it's playing outside its mother's pouch. Its mother is always nearby watching over it.
ZKN_ULMOON_116_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_117_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_118_000	The way it swims along fluttering its dress-like fins has earned it the name "princess of the water."
ZKN_ULMOON_119_000	To attract females, males dance on the river's floor. The females gather around the male that dances most gracefully.
ZKN_ULMOON_120_000	No number of injuries can bother Staryu. Its amazing regenerative powers return it to its previous state in half a day!
ZKN_ULMOON_121_000	It rotates its geometrically shaped body to swim through the water. It always seems to be sending out mysterious radio waves.
ZKN_ULMOON_122_000	It creates invisible walls with its pantomiming. If you don't act impressed, it will attack you with a double slap!
ZKN_ULMOON_123_000	Some call it a ninja. Its movements— imperceptibly quick—are sufficient to cleave the air in two. It's very popular in Alola.
ZKN_ULMOON_124_000	Its strange cries sound like human language. There are some musicians who compose songs for Jynx to sing.
ZKN_ULMOON_125_000	While it's often blamed for power outages, the truth is the cause of outages is more often an error on the part of the electric company.
ZKN_ULMOON_126_000	The hotter the place, the better they feel. Magmar in Alola are said to be hardier than those in other areas.
ZKN_ULMOON_127_000	Although it's tough, it can't handle cold well. When night falls, it buries itself in leafage and sleeps.
ZKN_ULMOON_128_000	The climate seems to be related to the reason Tauros in Alola are a little calmer than those in other regions.
ZKN_ULMOON_129_000	Thanks to their strong hold on life, dirty water doesn't bother them at all. They live in waters all over the world!
ZKN_ULMOON_130_000	The energy from evolution stimulated its brain cells strongly, causing it to become very ferocious.
ZKN_ULMOON_131_000	They've been so cherished that there's now an overabundance. The fish Pokémon population has declined in waters with too many Lapras.
ZKN_ULMOON_132_000	It transforms into whatever it sees. If the thing it's transforming into isn't right in front of it, Ditto relies on its memory—so sometimes it fails.
ZKN_ULMOON_133_000	Its genes are easily influenced by its surroundings. Even its face starts to look like that of its Trainer.
ZKN_ULMOON_134_000	It detects nearby moisture with its fin. When its fin begins trembling rapidly, that means rain will fall in a few hours.
ZKN_ULMOON_135_000	Its fur stands on end, becoming like needles it fires at enemies. Once they're weakened, it finishes them off with a 10,000 volt shock.
ZKN_ULMOON_136_000	The flame chamber inside its body ignites when Flareon gets agitated, reaching temperatures of up to 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit.
ZKN_ULMOON_137_000	It was built 20 years ago by scientists who dreamed of exploring space. Their dreams have yet to come true.

ZKN_ULMOON_139_000	It wraps its prey in its tentacles to immobilize them and then finishes them off with its sharp fangs.
ZKN_ULMOON_140_000	This Pokémon became extinct everywhere, except in a few areas. It protects itself with its hard shell.

ZKN_ULMOON_142_000	It flew through the open skies over the ancient continent as if they were its own. When it touched ground, its walk was weak and slow.
ZKN_ULMOON_143_000	It has no interest in anything other than eating. Even if you climb up on its stomach while it's napping, it doesn't seem to mind at all!
ZKN_ULMOON_144_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_145_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_146_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_147_000	It sheds its skin—almost on a daily basis—and grows larger. Its skin is soft just after it's been shed.
ZKN_ULMOON_148_000	Some say that if you see it at the start of the year, flying through the sky and twisting its body, you'll be healthy all year long.
ZKN_ULMOON_149_000	You'll often hear tales of this kindhearted Pokémon rescuing people or Pokémon that are drowning.

ZKN_ULMOON_161_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_162_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_163_000	It cries out at the same time every day. A long time ago, people cherished it and considered it a divine messenger sent to tell the time.
ZKN_ULMOON_164_000	When it turns its head entirely upside down, you know it's troubled by something. If you don't leave it be, it will peck you.
ZKN_ULMOON_165_000	These very cowardly Pokémon join together and use Reflect to protect their nest.
ZKN_ULMOON_166_000	It flies through the night sky, sprinkling sparkly dust. According to some, if that dust sticks to you, good things will happen to you.
ZKN_ULMOON_167_000	Although the poison from its fangs isn't that strong, it's potent enough to weaken prey that gets caught in its web.
ZKN_ULMOON_168_000	It spews threads from its mouth to catch its prey. When night falls, it leaves its web to go hunt aggressively.
ZKN_ULMOON_169_000	It feeds on the blood of living people and Pokémon. If it can't drink any blood for even a short while, it becomes weak and unable to fly.
ZKN_ULMOON_170_000	Chinchou blink their shining antennae at one another to claim their respective turf.
ZKN_ULMOON_171_000	It lives far down in the depths of the ocean. It blinds its prey with light, using the moment they're dazzled to swallow them whole.
ZKN_ULMOON_172_000	It has electric sacs in its cheeks. When they're fully charged, Pichu plays very energetically.
ZKN_ULMOON_173_000	Said to have ridden here on a shooting star, Cleffa seem to appear in places where meteorites have struck in the past.
ZKN_ULMOON_174_000	Left to its own devices, it will constantly practice singing. You should make it take a break so it doesn't hurt its throat.
ZKN_ULMOON_175_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_176_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_177_000	The look in its eyes gives the impression that it's carefully observing you. If you approach it, Natu will hop away.
ZKN_ULMOON_178_000	While it can see the future, it has no desire to change it, which is probably why it remains motionless at all times.
ZKN_ULMOON_179_000	Rubbing its fleece generates electricity. You'll want to pet it because it's cute, but if you use your bare hand, you'll get a painful shock.
ZKN_ULMOON_180_000	It stores electricity in its fluffy fleece. If it stores up too much, it will start to go bald in those patches.
ZKN_ULMOON_181_000	Its tail shines bright and strong. It has been prized since long ago as a beacon for sailors.
ZKN_ULMOON_182_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_183_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_184_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_185_000	The result of its holding the same pose all the time is arms that have become supple yet strong.
ZKN_ULMOON_186_000	The longer and more luxurious the curled hair on its head, the greater the number of Poliwag and Poliwhirl that will obey it.
ZKN_ULMOON_187_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_188_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_189_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_190_000	It searches for prey from the tops of trees. When it spots its favorite food, Bounsweet, Aipom gets excited and pounces.
ZKN_ULMOON_191_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_192_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_193_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_194_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_195_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_196_000	Psychic power builds up in the orb on its forehead as it bathes in the sunshine. Espeon is not good at battling at night.
ZKN_ULMOON_197_000	It lurks in the dark of night looking for prey. At the moment it pounces, the rings on its body glow dimly but ominously.
ZKN_ULMOON_198_000	It searches for shiny things for its boss. Murkrow's presence is said to be unlucky, so many people detest it.
ZKN_ULMOON_199_000	It's called "the sage of the sea." It engages in battles of wits with Oranguru, but the result is usually a draw.
ZKN_ULMOON_200_000	What makes it happy is imitating the voices of weeping people and scaring everyone. It doesn't deal well with folks who aren't easily frightened.
ZKN_ULMOON_201_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_202_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_203_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_204_000	It sticks tree bark to itself with its saliva, making itself thicker and larger. Elderly Pineco are ridiculously huge.

ZKN_ULMOON_209_000	In contrast to its appearance, it's quite timid. When playing with other puppy Pokémon, it sometimes gets bullied.
ZKN_ULMOON_210_000	Although it's popular with young people, Granbull is timid and sensitive, so it's totally incompetent as a watchdog.

ZKN_ULMOON_234_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_235_000	It draws symbols with the fluid that oozes from the tip of its tail. Depending on the symbol, Smeargle fanatics will pay big money for them.

ZKN_ULMOON_244_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_245_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_246_000	Raised on nutrients it finds in the dirt, it eats roughly a mountain's worth of dirt before it becomes a pupa.

ZKN_ULMOON_248_000	This Pokémon is a mobile disaster, leaving mountains crumbled and houses destroyed in its wake.

ZKN_ULMOON_295_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_296_000	There's a rumor of a traditional recipe for stew that Trainers can use to raise strong Makuhita.
ZKN_ULMOON_297_000	Hariyama that are big and fat aren't necessarily strong. There are some small ones that move nimbly and use moves skillfully.
ZKN_ULMOON_298_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_299_000	It hunts without twitching a muscle by pulling in its prey with powerful magnetism. But sometimes it pulls natural enemies in close.

ZKN_ULMOON_302_000	Materials from gems it has eaten float to the surface of its body and can form an infinite number of patterns among individuals.
ZKN_ULMOON_303_000	It has two mouths. The big jaws on the back of its head can't taste anything, so that's the mouth it uses to eat foods it doesn't like.

ZKN_ULMOON_318_000	With its sturdy jaws and fangs, it can easily chomp wooden boats to splinters. It fights with Basculin over food.
ZKN_ULMOON_319_000	It drinks in seawater and jets it from its rear to propel itself. It's very sensitive to the scent of blood.
ZKN_ULMOON_320_000	Due to their memories of when they once lived on land, pods of them will, very rarely, wash up on shore.
ZKN_ULMOON_321_000	When a small Wailmer is attacked by Sharpedo or Dhelmise, its whole pod works together to protect it.
ZKN_ULMOON_322_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_323_000

ZKN_ULMOON_325_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_326_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_327_000	Each Spinda's spot pattern is different. With its stumbling movements, it evades opponents' attacks brilliantly!
ZKN_ULMOON_328_000	It builds nests that double as traps, lying in wait for its prey to get caught. When night falls, it digs itself a spot beneath the sand to sleep.
ZKN_ULMOON_329_000	It vibrates its wings to send out odd sound waves. Trainers who are with it need earplugs.
ZKN_ULMOON_330_000	People continue to have their hearts stolen by its enchanting songs and find themselves stranded in the desert.

ZKN_ULMOON_337_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_338_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_339_000	Its whiskers are filled with nerves. They can sense smells and flavors just as a person's nose or tongue would.
ZKN_ULMOON_340_000	Its vision is not that good. It senses vibrations in the water with its whiskers to determine the location of its prey.
ZKN_ULMOON_341_000	It can adapt very well to its environment. Feebas and Corphish are about the only Pokémon to live in stagnant ditches.
ZKN_ULMOON_342_000	Its pincers often fall off. Unlike with Crabrawler or Clauncher, the meat in its claws is utterly nasty and stinking.
ZKN_ULMOON_343_000	When they find others of their kind, they cry out loudly and gather together. Large numbers of them can be found in old graveyards.
ZKN_ULMOON_344_000	The ancient people who made it apparently modeled it after something that descended from the sky. It fires beams from both arms.
ZKN_ULMOON_345_000	It sticks to rocks with its powerful suckers and can't be washed away no matter how rough the surf gets.
ZKN_ULMOON_346_000	This carnivorous Pokémon lived in primordial seas. It catches prey in its eight tentacles and dissolves them with digestive fluid as it eats.
ZKN_ULMOON_347_000	This is one kind of primeval bug Pokémon. With eight wings, it could apparently swim a lot faster than you'd expect.
ZKN_ULMOON_348_000	Armaldo adapted from living in water to living on land. It has been determined that it is the ancestor of some bug Pokémon.
ZKN_ULMOON_349_000	Because of its wretched appearance, most people pay it no attention, but there are some who collect Feebas—and Feebas alone!
ZKN_ULMOON_350_000	Its dwelling place is the bottom of big lakes. Those who behold its loveliness are said to have their hearts purified.
ZKN_ULMOON_351_000	Its form changes depending on the weather. The rougher conditions get, the rougher Castform's disposition!
ZKN_ULMOON_352_000	Its color changes for concealment and also when its mood or health changes. The darker the color, the healthier it is.
ZKN_ULMOON_353_000	There's a proverb that says, "Shun the house where Shuppet gather in the growing dusk."
ZKN_ULMOON_354_000	Resentment at being cast off made it spring into being. Some say that treating it well will satisfy it, and it will once more become a stuffed toy.
ZKN_ULMOON_355_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_356_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_357_000	Bunches of delicious fruit grow around its neck. In warm areas, many ranches raise Tropius.
ZKN_ULMOON_358_000

ZKN_ULMOON_361_000	Rich people from cold areas all share childhood memories of playing with Snorunt.
ZKN_ULMOON_362_000	Its actual body is a rock that isn't particularly hard. Glalie absorbs moisture from the air and drapes itself in an armor of ice.
ZKN_ULMOON_363_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_364_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_365_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_366_000	Clamperl's pearls are exceedingly precious. They can be more than 10 times as costly as Shellder's pearls.
ZKN_ULMOON_367_000	Deep seas are their habitat. According to tradition, when Huntail wash up onshore, something unfortunate will happen.
ZKN_ULMOON_368_000	It sucks bodily fluids out of its prey. The leftover meat sinks to the seafloor, where it becomes food for other Pokémon.
ZKN_ULMOON_369_000	The reason it hasn't changed at all in a hundred million years is that it's apparently already a perfect life-form.
ZKN_ULMOON_370_000	Luvdisc makes its home in coral reefs in warm seas. It especially likes sleeping in the space between Corsola's branches.
ZKN_ULMOON_371_000	Some theories suggest that its behavior of forcefully bashing its head into things stimulates cells that affect its evolution.
ZKN_ULMOON_372_000	Shelgon lives deep within caves. It stays shut up in its hard shell, dreaming of the day it will be able to fly.

ZKN_ULMOON_374_000	If you anger it, it will do more than rampage. It will also burst out strong magnetism, causing nearby machines to break.
ZKN_ULMOON_375_000	It flies at high speeds around the skies. When it finds its prey, Metang takes a firm grip with its sharp claws and never lets go.

ZKN_ULMOON_408_000	Its hard skull is its distinguishing feature. It snapped trees by headbutting them, and then it fed on their ripe berries.
ZKN_ULMOON_409_000	This ancient Pokémon used headbutts skillfully. Its brain was really small, so some theories suggest that its stupidity led to its extinction.
ZKN_ULMOON_410_000	Although its fossils can be found in layers of primeval rock, nothing but its face has ever been discovered.
ZKN_ULMOON_411_000	This Pokémon is from roughly 100 million years ago. Its terrifyingly tough face is harder than steel.

ZKN_ULMOON_425_000	Wandering souls gathered together to form this Pokémon. When trying to make friends with children, Drifloon grabs them by the hand.
ZKN_ULMOON_426_000	The raw material for the gas inside its body is souls. When its body starts to deflate, it's thought to carry away people and Pokémon.
ZKN_ULMOON_427_000	The reason it keeps one ear rolled up is so it can launch a swift counterattack if it's attacked by an enemy.
ZKN_ULMOON_428_000	It's notably wary and has a dislike of fighting, but at the same time, it can deliver powerful kicks with its lithe legs.
ZKN_ULMOON_429_000	Its muttered curses can cause awful headaches or terrifying visions that torment others.
ZKN_ULMOON_430_000	Its goons take care of most of the fighting for it. The only time it dirties its own hands is in delivering a final blow to finish off an opponent.

ZKN_ULMOON_441_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_442_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_443_000	Its original home is an area much hotter than Alola. If you're planning to live with one, your heating bill will soar.
ZKN_ULMOON_444_000	It sheds its skin and gradually grows larger. Its scales can be ground into a powder and used as raw materials for traditional medicine.
ZKN_ULMOON_445_000	Its fine scales don't just reduce wind resistance—their sharp edges also cause injury to any opponent who attacks it.
ZKN_ULMOON_446_000	Anything that looks edible, Munchlax will go on and swallow whole. Its stomach is tough enough to handle it even if the food has gone rotten.
ZKN_ULMOON_447_000	It uses waves called auras to communicate with others of its kind. It doesn't make any noise during this time, so its enemies can't detect it.
ZKN_ULMOON_448_000	Lucario reads its opponent's feelings with its aura waves. It finds out things it would rather not know, so it gets stressed out easily.

ZKN_ULMOON_458_000	Mantyke are friendly toward people and will approach boats closely. The patterns on their backs differ depending on their habitat.
ZKN_ULMOON_459_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_460_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_461_000	Thanks to its increased intelligence, scrapping over food is a thing of the past. A scratch from its claws will give you a case of frostbite!

ZKN_ULMOON_472_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_473_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_474_000	A faulty update was added to its programming. Its behavior is noticeably strange, so the experiment may have been a failure.
ZKN_ULMOON_475_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_476_000	It uses three small units to catch prey and battle enemies. The main body mostly just gives orders.
ZKN_ULMOON_477_000	
ZKN_ULMOON_478_000	It's said that on nights of terrible blizzards, it comes down to human settlements. If you hear it knocking at your door, do not open it!

ZKN_ULMOON_777_001	
ZKN_ULMOON_778_001	Sad that its true identity may be exposed, Mimikyu will mercilessly seek revenge on any opponent that breaks its neck.
ZKN_ULMOON_778_002	
ZKN_ULMOON_778_003	
ZKN_ULMOON_784_001	
ZKN_ULMOON_800_001	This is Necrozma's form while it's absorbing the power of Solgaleo, making it extremely ferocious and impossible to control.
ZKN_ULMOON_800_002	This is its form while it's devouring the light of Lunala. It grasps foes in its giant claws and rips them apart with brute force.
ZKN_ULMOON_800_003	The light pouring out from all over its body affects living things and nature, impacting them in various ways.
ZKN_ULMOON_801_001	It functions thanks to its artificial soul. The vivid decoration is proof that it was presented as a gift to royalty.

ZKN_ULSUN_009_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_010_000	Perhaps because it would like to grow up quickly, it has a voracious appetite, eating a hundred leaves a day.
ZKN_ULSUN_011_000	Its shell is filled with a thick liquid. All of the cells throughout its body are being rebuilt in preparation for evolution.
ZKN_ULSUN_012_000	Its wings are covered in toxic scales. If it finds bird Pokémon going after Caterpie, Butterfree sprinkles its scales on them to drive them off.
ZKN_ULSUN_013_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_014_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_015_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_016_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_017_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_018_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_019_000	Its incisors grow continuously throughout its life. If its incisors get too long, this Pokémon becomes unable to eat, and it starves to death.
ZKN_ULSUN_020_000	People say that it fled from its enemies by using its small webbed hind feet to swim from island to island in Alola.
ZKN_ULSUN_021_000	Its reckless nature leads it to stand up to others—even large Pokémon—if it has to protect its territory.
ZKN_ULSUN_022_000	Carrying food through Fearow's territory is dangerous. It will snatch the food away from you in a flash!
ZKN_ULSUN_023_000	By dislocating its jaw, it can swallow prey larger than itself. After a meal, it curls up and rests.
ZKN_ULSUN_024_000	The latest research has determined that there are over 20 possible arrangements of the patterns on its stomach.
ZKN_ULSUN_025_000	Its nature is to store up electricity. Forests where nests of Pikachu live are dangerous, since the trees are so often struck by lightning.
ZKN_ULSUN_026_000	As electricity builds up inside its body, it becomes more aggressive. One theory is that the electricity buildup is actually causing stress.
ZKN_ULSUN_027_000	It lives in areas of limited rainfall. When danger approaches, it curls up into a ball to protect its soft stomach.
ZKN_ULSUN_028_000	Its claws and horns often break off. The broken claws and horns can be used to carve plows for tilling farm fields.
ZKN_ULSUN_029_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_030_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_031_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_032_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_033_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_034_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_035_000	They're popular, but they're rare. Trainers who show them off recklessly may be targeted by thieves.
ZKN_ULSUN_036_000	It can't help but hear a pin drop from over half a mile away, so it lives deep in the mountains where there aren't many people or Pokémon.
ZKN_ULSUN_037_000	Its beautiful tails have made it very popular. However, if it's not brushed diligently, it will be a mass of tangles before you know it.
ZKN_ULSUN_038_000	It is vindictive and relentless by nature. Those who cross it even once will be cursed for a thousand years, along with their descendants.
ZKN_ULSUN_039_000	Recordings of Jigglypuff's strange lullabies can be purchased from department stores. These CDs can be found near the bedding area.
ZKN_ULSUN_040_000	Thanks to its bouncy body and fine fur, this Pokémon is sought after. Holding one in your arms while you sleep feels great.
ZKN_ULSUN_041_000	It has no eyeballs, so it can't see. It checks its surroundings via the ultrasonic waves it emits from its mouth.
ZKN_ULSUN_042_000	Every once in a while, you'll see a Golbat that's missing some fangs. This happens when hunger drives it to try biting a Steel-type Pokémon.
ZKN_ULSUN_043_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_044_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_045_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_046_000	Whether it's due to a lack of moisture or a lack of nutrients, in Alola the mushrooms on Paras don't grow up quite right.
ZKN_ULSUN_047_000	The bug is mostly dead, with the mushroom on its back having become the main body. If the mushroom comes off, the bug stops moving.
ZKN_ULSUN_048_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_049_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_050_000	It travels through tunnels that it digs underground. It hates sunlight, so it comes out only after the sun goes down.
ZKN_ULSUN_051_000	While the three of them normally get along splendidly, on rare occasions a huge fight will break out over which head gets to eat first.
ZKN_ULSUN_052_000	When visiting a junkyard, you may catch sight of it having an intense fight with Murkrow over shiny objects.
ZKN_ULSUN_053_000	Although the jewel on its forehead appears to be a different color than those of Alolan Persian, it's mostly made of the same material.
ZKN_ULSUN_054_000	Using psychokinesis gives it a headache, so it normally passes the time spacing out and doing as little as possible.
ZKN_ULSUN_055_000	Even fast-swimming fish Pokémon can be disabled by Golduck. It brings them to a standstill and seizes them.
ZKN_ULSUN_056_000	The smallest of things could cause it to lose its temper. Because it doesn't hold in its stress, this Pokémon can live a long time.
ZKN_ULSUN_057_000	It will never forgive opponents who have angered it. Even after it has beaten them down until they can't move, it never ever forgives.
ZKN_ULSUN_058_000	While it's quite friendly toward humans once it's grown used to them, in the wild it must be quite fierce to defend its territory from Rockruff.
ZKN_ULSUN_059_000	Legends tell of its fighting alongside a general and conquering a whole country.
ZKN_ULSUN_060_000	Despite the danger, it wants to come up on land. So it does its best to waddle along, but when an enemy finds it, it rushes back to the water.
ZKN_ULSUN_061_000	Although it has become capable of living on land, it spends its time in the water, where its prey, fish Pokémon, are plentiful.
ZKN_ULSUN_062_000	It's quite a gifted swimmer, even among Water-type Pokémon, but it normally spends its time on land.
ZKN_ULSUN_063_000	It uses various psychic powers even while it's sleeping, so you can't tell whether or not it's awake.
ZKN_ULSUN_064_000	It stares at a silver spoon to amplify its psychic powers before it lets loose. Apparently, gold spoons are no good.
ZKN_ULSUN_065_000	Alakazam uses its psychic powers to make the spoons it carries. Each spoon is an original that there's only one of in the whole world.
ZKN_ULSUN_066_000	Once this Pokémon has gained enough confidence and muscle from training with its friends, it challenges Makuhita to a battle.
ZKN_ULSUN_067_000	When it encounters an enemy that's truly mighty, this Pokémon removes the power-save belt from its waist and unleashes its full power.
ZKN_ULSUN_068_000	It grasps its opponents with its four arms and twists them up in an intricate hold. People call it "the Machamp special."
ZKN_ULSUN_069_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_070_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_071_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_072_000	It drifts through the sea searching for prey. Its poisonous tentacles break off sometimes, but after a while, they grow back.
ZKN_ULSUN_073_000	It fires off ultrasonic waves from its red orbs to weaken its prey, and then it wraps them up in its 80 tentacles.
ZKN_ULSUN_074_000	Geodude that have lived a long life have had all their edges smoothed out until they're totally round. They also have a calm, quiet disposition.
ZKN_ULSUN_075_000	It climbs up cliffs as it heads toward the peak of a mountain. As soon as it reaches the summit, it rolls back down the way it came.
ZKN_ULSUN_076_000	When Golem grow old, they stop shedding their shells. Those that have lived a long, long time have shells green with moss.
ZKN_ULSUN_077_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_078_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_079_000	There are some places where Slowpoke is worshiped because of a long-standing belief that whenever Slowpoke yawns, it rains.
ZKN_ULSUN_080_000	Spacing out is basically all it does. It turns back into Slowpoke if its tail, along with Shellder, breaks off.
ZKN_ULSUN_081_000	It's frequently the cause of power outages, which is why some power plants send out electrical signals that it can't stand.
ZKN_ULSUN_082_000	Delicate equipment can malfunction in areas inhabited by Magneton, which send out mysterious electrical signals.
ZKN_ULSUN_083_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_084_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_085_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_086_000	It has always been supposed that Seel live only in cold seas. Their having shown up in Alola is a mystery.
ZKN_ULSUN_087_000	It swims through the ocean at a speed of eight knots, searching for Pokémon that will become its prey. It's especially fond of Wishiwashi.
ZKN_ULSUN_088_000	It was born from sludge on the ocean floor. In a sterile environment, the germs within its body can't multiply, and it dies.
ZKN_ULSUN_089_000	Their food sources have decreased, and their numbers have declined sharply. Sludge ponds are being built to prevent their extinction.
ZKN_ULSUN_090_000	The sand that accumulates inside its shell eventually becomes a pearl. But the pearl gets in the way, so it spits it out and discards it.
ZKN_ULSUN_091_000	If areas of Cloyster's very hard shell get damaged, those areas swell, gradually growing into large sharp spikes.
ZKN_ULSUN_092_000	It's said that gas emanating from a graveyard was possessed by the grievances of the deceased and thus became a Pokémon.
ZKN_ULSUN_093_000	On moonless nights, Haunter searches for someone to curse, so it's best not to go out walking around.
ZKN_ULSUN_094_000	You can hear tales told all over the world about how Gengar will pay a visit to children who are naughty.
ZKN_ULSUN_095_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_096_000	It can be spotted near recreational facilities, intending to eat the pleasant dreams of children who enjoyed themselves there that day.
ZKN_ULSUN_097_000	In Alola, Komala is Hypno's main target. It rarely harms people.
ZKN_ULSUN_098_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_099_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_100_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_101_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_102_000	Six of them form a single Pokémon. Should one of the six be lost, the next morning there will once more be six.
ZKN_ULSUN_103_000	It engages its enemies using psychic powers. Each of its three heads fires off psychokinetic energy, tripling its power.
ZKN_ULSUN_104_000	At night, it weeps loudly for its dead mother, but those cries only attract its natural enemy—Mandibuzz.
ZKN_ULSUN_105_000	It throws bones at Mandibuzz to knock it down. It's thought that Marowak is trying to avenge its parent.
ZKN_ULSUN_106_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_107_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_108_000	It checks out whatever's around it by licking everything. If you don't clean off a spot where it's licked you, you'll break out in a rash!
ZKN_ULSUN_109_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_110_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_111_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_112_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_113_000	It seems that other Pokémon's efforts to take its delicious, nutritious egg away from it caused Chansey to get faster at fleeing.
ZKN_ULSUN_114_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_115_000	Kangaskhan protects its child by keeping it in its pouch. It has zero forgiveness for those who harm its child and will beat them down.
ZKN_ULSUN_116_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_117_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_118_000	Although known for their splendid tail fins, Goldeen apparently compete among themselves to see whose horn is thickest and sharpest.
ZKN_ULSUN_119_000	Its horn spins like a drill to steadily hollow out rocks—even harder ones. The coloration of the male is more vivid.
ZKN_ULSUN_120_000	In many places, there are folktales of stardust falling into the ocean and becoming Staryu.
ZKN_ULSUN_121_000	Its sparkling core is called "the gem of the sea." This core can be made into high-priced accessories that are traded in secret.
ZKN_ULSUN_122_000	Its pantomime skills are wonderful. You may become enraptured while watching it, but next thing you know, Mr. Mime has made a real wall.
ZKN_ULSUN_123_000	Its two sharp scythes are more than just weapons. It uses them with dexterity to dress its prey before eating.
ZKN_ULSUN_124_000	It sways its hips to a rhythm all its own. The precise movements of Jynx living in Alola are truly wonderful.
ZKN_ULSUN_125_000	Electricity permeates its body. It swings its arms round and round to charge up electricity before unleashing a punch.
ZKN_ULSUN_126_000	Its entire body is burning. When it breathes, the temperature rises. When it sneezes, flames shoot out!
ZKN_ULSUN_127_000	It gets into territorial disputes with Vikavolt. For some reason, it apparently gets along well with Heracross in Alola.
ZKN_ULSUN_128_000	They live in groups. The one with the longest, thickest, and most-scarred horns is the boss of the herd.
ZKN_ULSUN_129_000	In the distant past, they were fairly strong, but they have become gradually weaker over time.
ZKN_ULSUN_130_000	It fires hyper beams in all directions, burning the surrounding area to ash. There are some regions where it's called "the deity of destruction."
ZKN_ULSUN_131_000	It likes swimming around with people on its back. In the Alola region, it's an important means of transportation over water.
ZKN_ULSUN_132_000	While it can transform into anything, each Ditto apparently has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transformations.
ZKN_ULSUN_133_000	The question of why only Eevee has such unstable genes has still not been solved.
ZKN_ULSUN_134_000	Clean, clear waters are its usual habitat. When it's about to be attacked by an invading enemy, it dives into the water to hide.
ZKN_ULSUN_135_000	Its lungs contain an organ that creates electricity. The crackling sound of electricity can be heard when it exhales.
ZKN_ULSUN_136_000	If it inhales deeply, that's a sign it's about to attack. Prepare to be hit by flames of over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit!
ZKN_ULSUN_137_000	This Pokémon was created using the cutting-edge science of 20 years ago, so many parts of it have since become obsolete.
ZKN_ULSUN_138_000	Omanyte lived in the seas of antiquity. Its fossils have been found bearing bite marks from Archeops, so apparently Archeops preyed on it.
ZKN_ULSUN_139_000	Its heavy shell is thought to be the reason this ancient Pokémon died out. It's apparently a distant ancestor of Octillery.
ZKN_ULSUN_140_000	This Pokémon thrived 300 million years ago. It's said that living specimens can still be seen in a certain region—a rare sight.
ZKN_ULSUN_141_000	Its body had begun to change so it could function on land. But it didn't adapt in time and went extinct.
ZKN_ULSUN_142_000	Restored from DNA found in amber, this Pokémon exhibited ferocity that was greater than expected. Some casualties resulted.
ZKN_ULSUN_143_000	It doesn't do anything other than eat and sleep. When prompted to make a serious effort, though, it apparently displays awesome power.
ZKN_ULSUN_144_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_145_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_146_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_147_000	It's still weak, so it lurks on the floor of bodies of water, eating whatever food sinks down and living a quiet life.
ZKN_ULSUN_148_000	Lakes where Dragonair live are filled with offerings from people, because they believe this Pokémon is able to control the weather.
ZKN_ULSUN_149_000	It flies over raging seas as if they were nothing. Observing this, a ship's captain dubbed this Pokémon "the sea incarnate."
ZKN_ULSUN_150_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_151_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_152_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_153_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_154_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_155_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_156_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_157_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_158_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_159_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_160_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_161_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_162_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_163_000	Every day, it tilts its head in the same rhythm. A long time ago, people raised these Pokémon to serve as clocks.
ZKN_ULSUN_164_000	With eyes that can see in pitch-darkness, it never lets its prey escape. Some even call it "the emperor of dark nights."
ZKN_ULSUN_165_000	This Pokémon is very sensitive to cold. In the warmth of Alola, it appears quite lively.
ZKN_ULSUN_166_000	It's said that the patterns on its back are related to the stars in the night sky, but the details of that relationship remain unclear.
ZKN_ULSUN_167_000	With threads from its mouth, it fashions sturdy webs that won't break even if you set a rock on them.
ZKN_ULSUN_168_000	Every night, it wanders around in search of prey, whose movements it restrains by spewing threads before it bites into them with its fangs.
ZKN_ULSUN_169_000	Its fangs are so sharp, if it bites you in the dark and sucks your blood, you won't notice any pain or realize you've been bitten.
ZKN_ULSUN_170_000	Its two antennae glow softly to lure in prey, making it a useful Pokémon for night fishing.
ZKN_ULSUN_171_000	When the bacteria living inside its antennae absorb Lanturn's bodily fluids, a strong luminescent effect is produced.
ZKN_ULSUN_172_000	It still can't use electricity well. When it's surprised or excited, it discharges electricity unintentionally.
ZKN_ULSUN_173_000	On nights with many shooting stars, they gather in packs and dance in circles. If you should see them, something good will happen!
ZKN_ULSUN_174_000	It's always practicing its singing because it wants to improve. Even when it's asleep, it keeps singing in its dreams!
ZKN_ULSUN_175_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_176_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_177_000	Although it still can't fly, its jumping power is outstanding. It jumps way up into trees and plucks the buds from the branches.
ZKN_ULSUN_178_000	It's said that while this Pokémon has the power to predict the future, it's not powerful enough to change the future it sees.
ZKN_ULSUN_179_000	Clothing made from Mareep's fleece is easily charged with static electricity, so a special process is used on it.
ZKN_ULSUN_180_000	In the places on its body where fleece doesn't grow, its skin is rubbery and doesn't conduct electricity. Those spots are safe to touch.
ZKN_ULSUN_181_000	The light from its tail can be seen from space. This is why you can always tell exactly where it is, which is why it usually keeps the light off.
ZKN_ULSUN_182_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_183_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_184_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_185_000	It's so popular with the elderly that there's a magazine devoted to this Pokémon. Fans obsess over the particular length and angle of its arms.
ZKN_ULSUN_186_000	Although its cries sound like screams, a composer created a beautiful ballad that was influenced by the sounds.
ZKN_ULSUN_187_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_188_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_189_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_190_000	As it did more and more with its tail, its hands became clumsy. It makes its nest high in the treetops.
ZKN_ULSUN_191_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_192_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_193_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_194_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_195_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_196_000	Although it originally had no powers at all, people say its precognitive faculties were awakened by its need to protect itself.
ZKN_ULSUN_197_000	This Pokémon is nocturnal. Even in total darkness, its large eyes can spot its prey clearly!
ZKN_ULSUN_198_000	It has a weakness for shiny things. It's been known to sneak into the nests of Gabite—noted collectors of jewels—in search of treasure.
ZKN_ULSUN_199_000	It's constantly coming up with new ideas that would change the world, but as soon as it hits upon a new idea, it forgets it.
ZKN_ULSUN_200_000	What gives meaning to its life is surprising others. If you set your ear against the red orbs around its neck, you can hear shrieking.
ZKN_ULSUN_201_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_202_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_203_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_204_000	Motionless, it hangs from trees, waiting for its bug Pokémon prey to come to it. Its favorite in Alola is Cutiefly.
ZKN_ULSUN_205_000	When something approaches it, it fires off fragments of its steel shell in attack. This is not a conscious action but a conditioned reflex.
ZKN_ULSUN_206_000	It travels by digging through the ground. Diglett and Dunsparce share one another's tunnels happily.
ZKN_ULSUN_207_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_208_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_209_000	It grows close to others easily and is also easily spoiled. The disparity between its face and its actions makes many young people wild about it.
ZKN_ULSUN_210_000	While it has powerful jaws, it doesn't care for disputes, so it rarely has a chance to display their might.
ZKN_ULSUN_211_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_212_000	Its body is like steel. Its tough, heavy pincers are more suited to smashing enemies than grabbing them.
ZKN_ULSUN_213_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_214_000	It's proud of its thick horn. In Alola, its biggest rival is Vikavolt, which it's always fighting with.
ZKN_ULSUN_215_000	They will cooperate to steal eggs from the nests of bird Pokémon, but fights break out to determine which one gets to eat the eggs.
ZKN_ULSUN_216_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_217_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_218_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_219_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_220_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_221_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_222_000	The pink of Corsola that live in Alola is deep and vibrant, thanks to seas filled with nutrition.
ZKN_ULSUN_223_000	This Pokémon clings to Mantine and shares in its prosperity. When its Mantine is attacked, Remoraid will fight alongside it!
ZKN_ULSUN_224_000	The ink it spits when escaping is special. It contains a substance that dulls the sense of smell, so Pokémon with keen noses get lost.
ZKN_ULSUN_225_000	It shares its food with people who are stranded. Because Delibird is omnivorous, sometimes it gives those people bug Pokémon.
ZKN_ULSUN_226_000	Postcards and posters featuring Mantine leaping elegantly above the waves are popular souvenirs of Alola.
ZKN_ULSUN_227_000	The wing feathers it sheds can be processed and made into knives whose sharpness is recognized by the finest chefs.
ZKN_ULSUN_228_000	It cooperates with others skillfully. When it becomes your partner, it's very loyal to you as its Trainer and will obey your orders.
ZKN_ULSUN_229_000	They spew flames mixed with poison to finish off their opponents. They divvy up their prey evenly among the members of their pack.
ZKN_ULSUN_230_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_231_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_232_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_233_000	AI has been installed in it. It learns various things all on its own, but it even remembers things it doesn't need to know.
ZKN_ULSUN_234_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_235_000	The fluid of Smeargle's tail secretions changes in the intensity of its hue as the Pokémon's emotions change.
ZKN_ULSUN_236_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_237_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_238_000	When it examines things, before touching them with its hands, it makes lip contact and then diligently licks all the dirt off its lips.
ZKN_ULSUN_239_000	When it hears the crash of thunder, Elekid's mood improves. It can be useful to record that sound and play it when Elekid's feeling down.
ZKN_ULSUN_240_000	When flames drip from its nose, that means it has a cold. Have it lie down for a nice rest in some magma.
ZKN_ULSUN_241_000	It produces over five gallons of milk a day. The higher the quality of the pastures it lives in, the richer and tastier its milk becomes.
ZKN_ULSUN_242_000	Their eggs are such a delicacy that some say eating one will bring you happiness. These eggs fetch the highest prices on the market.

ZKN_ULSUN_245_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_246_000	Born underground, it eats its way through dirt to the surface, where its parents are. It doesn't deal well with the bright light it finds there.

ZKN_ULSUN_248_000	It wanders through the mountains seeking opponents to fight. If it finds an opponent that's not worthy, Tyranitar ignores it and wanders on.

ZKN_ULSUN_282_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_283_000	If it's in a pinch, it will secrete a sweet liquid from the tip of its head. Syrup made from gathering that liquid is tasty on bread.
ZKN_ULSUN_284_000	Masquerain intimidates enemies with the eyelike patterns of its eyespots. If that doesn't work, it deftly makes its escape on its set of four wings.

ZKN_ULSUN_298_000

ZKN_ULSUN_307_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_308_000

ZKN_ULSUN_316_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_317_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_318_000	They're such cowards that they won't hunt alone. When five or so of them get together, they suddenly turn ferocious!
ZKN_ULSUN_319_000	People believe that carrying one of its discarded fangs will prevent mishaps at sea, so the fangs are made into accessories.
ZKN_ULSUN_320_000	It swims along with its mouth open and swallows down seawater along with its food. It sprays excess water out of its nostrils.
ZKN_ULSUN_321_000	They eat so many fish Pokémon that when Wailord become too numerous, fishermen have to chase them off.
ZKN_ULSUN_322_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_323_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_324_000	You can tell how it's feeling by the smoke spouting from its shell. Tremendous velocity is a sign of good health.
ZKN_ULSUN_325_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_326_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_327_000	Its steps are shaky and stumbling. Walking for a long time makes it feel sick.
ZKN_ULSUN_328_000	Its jaws are strong enough to crush rocks but so heavy that it can't get up if it flips over. Sandile seize those moments as their chance.
ZKN_ULSUN_329_000	It vibrates its wings to generate ultrasonic waves, causing its prey to faint. Then it buries the prey alive in the sand to preserve it.
ZKN_ULSUN_330_000	By flapping their wings, Flygon cause sandstorms that conceal Krookodile. The team then splits the prey they catch.

ZKN_ULSUN_337_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_338_000

ZKN_ULSUN_342_000	Its temperament is rough and it loves to fight, but as soon as its pincers break off, it turns cowardly. It stays timid until they grow back.
ZKN_ULSUN_343_000	Depictions of Pokémon similar to Baltoy have been found on the walls of caves where primitive humans lived.

ZKN_ULSUN_347_000	When restored Anorith are released into the ocean, they don't thrive, because the water composition has changed since their era.
ZKN_ULSUN_348_000	It lived on land and went out into the sea to hunt for prey. Its sharp claws were its greatest weapon.
ZKN_ULSUN_349_000	They look ragged, so no one catches them. They look like they'd taste bad, so predators won't eat them. And their numbers continue to grow.
ZKN_ULSUN_350_000	While Milotic is said to be the most beautiful Pokémon, Trainers who like Feebas and have raised it are seemingly disappointed by Milotic.
ZKN_ULSUN_351_000	Although its form changes with the weather, that is apparently the result of a chemical reaction and not the result of its own free will.
ZKN_ULSUN_352_000	It changes its hue to blend into its surroundings. If no one takes notice of it for too long, it will pout and never reveal itself.
ZKN_ULSUN_353_000	It eats up emotions like malice, jealousy, and resentment, so some people are grateful for its presence.
ZKN_ULSUN_354_000	It's a stuffed toy that was thrown away and became possessed, ever searching for the one who threw it away so it can exact its revenge.
ZKN_ULSUN_355_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_356_000

ZKN_ULSUN_358_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_359_000	The only thing unlucky about Absol is its appearance. It protects fields and warns people of disaster, so one ought to be grateful for it.

ZKN_ULSUN_361_000	It feeds mainly on ice and snow. It's only able to survive in a limited number of places in the warm Alola region.

ZKN_ULSUN_363_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_364_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_365_000

ZKN_ULSUN_368_000	The color of its body changes with the water temperature. The coloration of Gorebyss in Alola is almost blindingly vivid.
ZKN_ULSUN_369_000	Thought to have gone extinct, Relicanth was given a name that is a variation of the name of the person who discovered it.
ZKN_ULSUN_370_000	There was an era when it was overfished due to the rumor that having one of its heart-shaped scales would enable you to find a sweetheart.
ZKN_ULSUN_371_000	Whenever it sees bird Pokémon flying through the sky, it becomes envious and smashes its surroundings to bits with headbutts.
ZKN_ULSUN_372_000	The cells within its body are changing at a bewildering pace. Its hard shell is made from the same substance as bone.
ZKN_ULSUN_373_000	Overjoyed at finally being able to fly, it flies all over the place and usually doesn't land until it's completely exhausted and needs to sleep.
ZKN_ULSUN_374_000	Instead of blood, magnetism flows through its body. When it's feeling bad, try giving it a magnet.
ZKN_ULSUN_375_000	With its two brains, it fires powerful psychic energy to stop its prey in their tracks.
ZKN_ULSUN_376_000	It boasts not only psychic powers but also fantastic strength. It grabs its prey with its four legs and holds them in place with its claws.

ZKN_ULSUN_407_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_408_000	A primeval Pokémon, it possesses a hard and sturdy skull, lacking any intelligence within.
ZKN_ULSUN_409_000	In ancient times, people would dig up fossils of this Pokémon and use its skull, which is harder than steel, to make helmets.
ZKN_ULSUN_410_000	A mild-mannered, herbivorous Pokémon, it used its face to dig up tree roots to eat. The skin on its face was plenty tough.
ZKN_ULSUN_411_000	The bones of its face are huge and hard, so they were mistaken for its spine until after this Pokémon was successfully restored.

ZKN_ULSUN_422_000	While they normally live in the sea, they can function on land, too, until their skin dries out.
ZKN_ULSUN_423_000	Long ago, it had a shell on its back. There's now a vestigial plate on its back that's hard but thin.
ZKN_ULSUN_424_000	In their search for comfortable trees, they get into territorial disputes with groups of Passimian. They win about half the time.

ZKN_ULSUN_426_000	There's a rumor that if you catch a Drifblim floating on the wind at dusk, you'll be carried away to the afterlife.

ZKN_ULSUN_430_000	It will absolutely not forgive failure from or betrayal by its goons. It has no choice in this if it wants to maintain the order of the flock.

ZKN_ULSUN_436_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_437_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_438_000	It discharges moisture from its eyes, making it look like it's crying—apparently an effective way of getting enemies to let down their guard.
ZKN_ULSUN_439_000	It does its absolute best to mimic the movements and expressions of its opponents, but it's still not very good at it.
ZKN_ULSUN_440_000	Usually it's a well-behaved Pokémon, but if you take its round rock away, it will cry and fuss and throw a big old tantrum.
ZKN_ULSUN_441_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_442_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_443_000	It reacts to anything that moves—flies right at it and bites it. Sometimes it injures itself, but it doesn't care too much.
ZKN_ULSUN_444_000	It loves shiny things. When it finds a Sableye trying to catch a Carbink, Gabite becomes furiously angry and attacks the Sableye.

ZKN_ULSUN_454_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_455_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_456_000	When night falls, their pink patterns begin to shine. They're popular with divers, so there are resorts that feed them to keep them close.
ZKN_ULSUN_457_000	Deep down at the bottom of the ocean, prey is scarce. Lumineon get into fierce disputes with Lanturn over food.
ZKN_ULSUN_458_000	It's highly friendly and easily tamed. Tours that take people swimming with Mantyke are a super-popular beach activity.
ZKN_ULSUN_459_000

ZKN_ULSUN_472_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_473_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_474_000	Its behavior is noticeably unstable, which is apparently due to the incompetence of the engineer who updated its programming.
ZKN_ULSUN_475_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_476_000	Although it can control its units known as Mini-Noses, they sometimes get lost and don't come back.
ZKN_ULSUN_477_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_478_000	It freezes hikers who have come to climb snowy mountains and carries them back to its home. It only goes after men it thinks are handsome.

ZKN_ULSUN_504_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_505_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_506_000	This Pokémon has excellent judgment. If it decides it can't defeat an opponent, it immediately turns tail and vamooses.
ZKN_ULSUN_507_000	The longer its black fur grows, the harder and more impervious it gets. Claws and fangs can't easily penetrate it.
ZKN_ULSUN_508_000	It pays no mind to the cold, thanks to its long warm coat. Stoutland in Alola look a little uncomfortable.

ZKN_ULSUN_522_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_523_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_524_000	The hexagonal hole is its ear. Deep in that ear is an energy core, so if you stick your hand in there, Roggenrola will be very angry!
ZKN_ULSUN_525_000	The energy overflowing from its body has turned into orange crystals that are hard enough to smash diamonds.
ZKN_ULSUN_526_000	When it fires off energy with all its might, the power creates countless fissures on its body.

ZKN_ULSUN_545_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_546_000	To protect itself, it shoots cotton from its body. When it gets wet in the rain, its cotton grows moist and heavy, and it can't move as well.
ZKN_ULSUN_547_000	This nuisance sneaks into people's homes, where it hides important things and scatters cotton all over the place.
ZKN_ULSUN_548_000	Some say if you dry the leaves on its head, boil them down, and drink the infusion, your vigor will return, so Petilil is popular with the elderly.
ZKN_ULSUN_549_000	The fragrance of its flower differs slightly depending on the soil where it grew up. Sniffing the aroma calms your heart and mind.
ZKN_ULSUN_550_000	Savage, violent Pokémon, red and blue Basculin are always fighting each other over territory.
ZKN_ULSUN_551_000	Alola, where it's warm all year round, is a comfortable environment for this Pokémon. Sometimes you'll even see it outside of deserts.
ZKN_ULSUN_552_000	Krokorok really hates it when its body gets cold. On nights when the temperature drops, it digs deep into the desert sands.
ZKN_ULSUN_553_000	When it spots prey, even at a distance of over 30 miles, it swims through the desert as if it were water, then jumps out and chomps them.

ZKN_ULSUN_557_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_558_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_559_000	They move in small groups, walking around lazily. Anyone who makes eye contact gets smacked with a headbutt.
ZKN_ULSUN_560_000	This Pokémon may be rude, but it takes very good care of its family, its friends, and its turf.
ZKN_ULSUN_561_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_562_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_563_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_564_000	It was restored from an ancient fossil. Tirtouga lived in the sea but came up onto the land to search for prey.
ZKN_ULSUN_565_000	Its jaws are terrifyingly powerful. It could eat Omastar and Omanyte whole and not be bothered in the slightest by their shells.
ZKN_ULSUN_566_000	Once thought to be the ancestor of all bird Pokémon, some of the latest research suggests that may not be the case.
ZKN_ULSUN_567_000	This ancient Pokémon's plumage is delicate, so if anyone other than an experienced professional tries to restore it, they will fail.

ZKN_ULSUN_585_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_586_000

ZKN_ULSUN_622_000	Its movements are powered by a mysterious energy. It has continued to move since ancient times, so its power may soon run out.
ZKN_ULSUN_623_000	Some say that ancient people invented Golurk to serve as a laborer. It follows its master's orders faithfully.
ZKN_ULSUN_624_000	After shredding its prey, it sharpens its blades on a stone by the river. Each Pawniard has its own favorite sharpening stone.

ZKN_ULSUN_626_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_627_000	With its powerful legs and sturdy claws, it can crack even the hard shells of Shellder and pluck out their insides.
ZKN_ULSUN_628_000	The more scars it has on its front, the more heroic it's considered to be. Those with many scars on their back are mocked by the flock.
ZKN_ULSUN_629_000	Mandibuzz gives it the bones it wears. Vullaby's wings are short, so it can't fly yet, but it jumps around, dreaming of wide open skies.
ZKN_ULSUN_630_000	It skillfully arranges the bones of its prey to construct its nest. Most of the bones are Cubone.

ZKN_ULSUN_664_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_665_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_666_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_667_000	When they're young, they live with a pride. Once they're able to hunt prey on their own, they're kicked out and have to make their own way.
ZKN_ULSUN_668_000	The males are usually lazy, but when attacked by a strong foe, a male will protect its friends with no regard for its own safety.
ZKN_ULSUN_669_000	It's not safe without the power of a flower, but it will keep traveling around until it finds one with the color and shape it wants.
ZKN_ULSUN_670_000	It raises flowers and uses them as weapons. The more gorgeous the blossom, the more power it contains.

ZKN_ULSUN_672_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_673_000

ZKN_ULSUN_688_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_689_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_690_000	It vanishes into seaweed and remains perfectly still to avoid attacks from large Pokémon. Rotten seaweed is its main food source.
ZKN_ULSUN_691_000	This vicious Pokémon sprays a poisonous liquid on opponents that come near. For whatever reason, it gets along really well with Dhelmise.
ZKN_ULSUN_692_000	Its claws occasionally fall off, and it keeps a low profile until they grow back. The meat of its claws is so delicious!
ZKN_ULSUN_693_000	It compresses the water it has sucked up and then projects it with enough power to punch a hole right through a thick sheet of iron.
ZKN_ULSUN_694_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_695_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_696_000	Its large jaw has incredible destructive power. Some theories suggest that its restored form is different from its form of long ago.
ZKN_ULSUN_697_000	Complete restoration is impossible, allowing room for theories that its entire body was once covered in a feather-like coat.
ZKN_ULSUN_698_000	It lived in cold areas in ancient times. It's said that when Amaura whinnies, auroras appear in the night sky.
ZKN_ULSUN_699_000	An Aurorus was found frozen solid within a glacier, just as it appeared long ago, which became quite a big event in the news.
ZKN_ULSUN_700_000	Once a fight breaks out, it will unflinchingly charge at dragon Pokémon that are many times larger than itself.
ZKN_ULSUN_701_000	It overwhelms opponents with quick moves, but sometimes it showboats for too long when it's using a special move and gets itself into a pinch.
ZKN_ULSUN_702_000	It sneaks into people's homes and steals electricity from their outlets. When your electric bill seems off, it's the handiwork of this rascal.
ZKN_ULSUN_703_000	Some say that deep beneath the surface of the world, a pack of Carbink live with their queen in a kingdom of jewels.
ZKN_ULSUN_704_000	It uses its horns to check out its surroundings. They're very sensitive, so if you grab them, it will feel a strong shock and be unable to move.
ZKN_ULSUN_705_000	It crawls along sluggishly. The swirly protrusion on its back is filled with its brain and other organs.
ZKN_ULSUN_706_000	It's very friendly toward people. If you grow close to it, Goodra will hug you with its sticky, slime-covered body. Don't get mad.
ZKN_ULSUN_707_000	Although it's unclear why it collects keys, giving it a key makes Klefki very happy. However, it apparently only likes master keys.
ZKN_ULSUN_708_000	By imitating the voice of a child, it causes people to get hopelessly lost deep in the forest. It's trying to make friends with them.
ZKN_ULSUN_709_000	It's feared as a ghost of the forest. Lumberjacks bring along Fire types, which Trevenant hates, when they enter the forest.

ZKN_ULSUN_712_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_713_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_714_000	Fruits are its favorite foods. This gourmet carefully picks out just the ripe ones using its sonar.

ZKN_ULSUN_717_000

ZKN_ULSUN_720_000	
ZKN_ULSUN_721_000

ZKN_ULSUN_723_000	This narcissistic Pokémon is a clean freak. If you don't groom it diligently, it will stop listening to you.
ZKN_ULSUN_724_000	It nocks its arrow quills and shoots them at opponents. When it simply can't afford to miss, it tugs the vine on its head to improve its focus.
ZKN_ULSUN_725_000	If you try too hard to get close to it, it won't open up to you. Even if you do grow close, giving it too much affection is still a no-no.
ZKN_ULSUN_726_000	It can act spoiled if it grows close to its Trainer. A powerful Pokémon, its sharp claws can leave its Trainer's whole body covered in scratches.
ZKN_ULSUN_727_000	Although it's rough mannered and egotistical, it finds beating down unworthy opponents boring. It gets motivated for stronger opponents.
ZKN_ULSUN_728_000	The balloons it inflates with its nose grow larger and larger as it practices day by day.
ZKN_ULSUN_729_000	It gets excited when it sees a dance it doesn't know. This hard worker practices diligently until it can learn that dance.
ZKN_ULSUN_730_000	To Primarina, every battle is a stage. It takes down its prey with beautiful singing and dancing.
ZKN_ULSUN_731_000	It pecks at trees with its hard beak. You can get some idea of its mood or condition from the rhythm of its pecking.
ZKN_ULSUN_732_000	It can bend the tip of its beak to produce over a hundred different cries at will.
ZKN_ULSUN_733_000	They smack beaks with others of their kind to communicate. The strength and number of hits tell each other how they feel.
ZKN_ULSUN_734_000	Its stomach takes up most of its long torso. It's a big eater, so the amount Trainers have to spend on its food is no laughing matter.
ZKN_ULSUN_735_000	Although it wasn't originally found in Alola, this Pokémon was brought over a long time ago when there was a huge Rattata outbreak.
ZKN_ULSUN_736_000	If you find its nest, you shouldn't stick your hand inside. You'll get bitten by an irritated Grubbin.
ZKN_ULSUN_737_000	It buries itself in fallen leaves and barely moves, munching away on humus. If you accidentally step on one, you'll get a shock!
ZKN_ULSUN_738_000	It has an organ that generates electricity in its abdomen. It concentrates energy in its strong jaws and fires off powerful jolts of electricity.
ZKN_ULSUN_739_000	Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense and defense. Fights between two Crabrawler are like boxing matches.
ZKN_ULSUN_740_000	It stores coldness in its pincers and pummels its foes. It can even smash thick walls of ice to bits!
ZKN_ULSUN_741_000	It wins the hearts of its enemies with its passionate dancing and then uses the opening it creates to burn them up with blazing flames.
ZKN_ULSUN_742_000	Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. In fields of flowers, it gets into skirmishes with Butterfree over food.
ZKN_ULSUN_743_000	Rain makes pollen damp, so Ribombee hates rain. When it sees ominous clouds, it finds a hollow in a tree, where it waits stock-still.
ZKN_ULSUN_744_000	As they develop, their disposition grows more violent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them too much to handle and abandon them.
ZKN_ULSUN_745_000	The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives. Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees before finishing them off.
ZKN_ULSUN_746_000	They're weak, so they move in schools. However, they can also often be seen all alone, having strayed from the school.
ZKN_ULSUN_747_000	They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola branches that have naturally fallen off.
ZKN_ULSUN_748_000	To attack, this Pokémon sends toxic spikes flying at its enemies. Ones that come close get mown down by the claws on its feet.
ZKN_ULSUN_749_000	It loves playing in the mud. If it isn't showered with mud on a daily basis, it gets stressed out and stops listening to its Trainer.
ZKN_ULSUN_750_000	It remains calm and unmoving no matter the situation. It mixes dirt with the saliva in its mouth to make a special kind of mud.
ZKN_ULSUN_751_000	When two Dewpider meet, they display their water bubbles to each other. Then the one with the smaller bubble gets out of the other's way.
ZKN_ULSUN_752_000	It usually passes its time in the water. When its belly is full, it stores its subdued prey in the water bubble on its head.
ZKN_ULSUN_753_000	When the sun rises, Fomantis spreads its four leaves and bathes in the sunlight. The tip of its head has a pleasant aroma.
ZKN_ULSUN_754_000	For self-protection, it pretends to be a bug Pokémon. Both of its arms bear keen-edged petals.
ZKN_ULSUN_755_000	It scatters its shining spores around itself. Even though they're dangerous, nighttime tours of forests where Morelull live are popular.
ZKN_ULSUN_756_000	It puts its prey to sleep and siphons off their vitality through the tip of its arms. If one of its kind is weakened, it helps by sending it vitality.
ZKN_ULSUN_757_000	The males will do whatever the females tell them. They give the females most of their food. Due to malnutrition, the males can't evolve.
ZKN_ULSUN_758_000	Salazzle lives deep in caves and forces the Salandit it has attracted with its pheromones to serve it.

ZKN_ULSUN_760_000	It waves its hands wildly in intimidation and warning. Life is over for anyone who doesn't run away as fast as possible.
ZKN_ULSUN_761_000	Because of its sweet, delicious aroma, bird Pokémon are always after it, but it's not intelligent enough to care.
ZKN_ULSUN_762_000	It's protected by its hard sepals, so it plays with bird Pokémon without worry. They peck it relentlessly, but it doesn't care.
ZKN_ULSUN_763_000	A master of grand and beautiful kicks, it can knock out even kickboxing champions with a single blow.
ZKN_ULSUN_764_000	It stretches sticky vines out from its head and picks flowers to adorn itself with. When it doesn't have any flowers, it feels uneasy.

ZKN_ULSUN_766_000	They use their saliva to stick leaves to their shoulders. You can tell what troop they belong to from the position of the leaves.
ZKN_ULSUN_767_000	It will pick up anything it finds on the ground. Sometimes it finds coins, so Murkrow and Meowth will go after it.
ZKN_ULSUN_768_000	The shell covering its body is as hard as diamond. This Pokémon will do anything it takes to win.
ZKN_ULSUN_769_000	It likes the shovel on its head, so Sandygast will get serious and fight any children who come to take it back.
ZKN_ULSUN_770_000	Each of its grains of sand has its own will. Palossand eats small Pokémon and siphons away their vital essence while they're still alive.
ZKN_ULSUN_771_000	The tradition known as Pyukumuku chucking started from the custom of throwing Pyukumuku back into the sea after they wash onshore.
ZKN_ULSUN_772_000	A Pokémon weapon developed for a specific mission, it went berserk during an experiment, so it was cryogenically frozen.
ZKN_ULSUN_773_000	This is its form once it has awakened and evolved. Freed from its heavy mask, its speed is greatly increased.
ZKN_ULSUN_774_000	It lives in the ozone layer, where it becomes food for stronger Pokémon. When it tries to run away, it falls to the ground.

ZKN_ULSUN_776_000	It lives in volcanoes and eats sulfur and other minerals. Materials from the food it eats form the basis of its explosive shell.
ZKN_ULSUN_777_000	When it's surprised or agitated, the 14 fur spikes on its back will stand up involuntarily.
ZKN_ULSUN_778_000	Although it's a quiet, lonely Pokémon, if you try to look at what's under its rag, it will become agitated and resist violently.
ZKN_ULSUN_779_000	It burrows beneath the sand, radiating psychic power from the protuberance on its head. It waits for prey as it surveys the area.

ZKN_ULSUN_784_000	When it howls after finishing off its prey, the metallic sounds of its celebrating comrades can be heard from all around.
ZKN_ULSUN_785_000	Although it's called a guardian deity, if a person or Pokémon puts it in a bad mood, it will become a malevolent deity and attack.

ZKN_ULSUN_787_000	Although it's called a guardian deity, it's violent enough to crush anyone it sees as an enemy.
ZKN_ULSUN_788_000	This guardian deity of Poni Island manipulates water. Because it lives deep within a thick fog, it came to be both feared and revered.
ZKN_ULSUN_789_000	Even though its helpless, gaseous body can be blown away by the slightest breeze, it doesn't seem to care.
ZKN_ULSUN_790_000	The king who ruled Alola in times of antiquity called it the "cocoon of the stars" and built an altar to worship it.

ZKN_VIOLET_0778_001	It has taken damage and can no longer hold the head of its cloth disguise upright. For as long as it lives, Mimikyu will never forget its attacker.

ZKN_VIOLET_0784_000	It bashes its scales to test its opponents' mettle. The sound of struck Kommo-o scales frightens weaker foes and sends them running.

ZKN_VIOLET_0809_999	
ZKN_VIOLET_0810_000	As Grookey strikes everything in sight with its stick, it has more and more fun, and its rhythm becomes livelier.
ZKN_VIOLET_0811_000	It becomes intensely focused while it drums out vigorous beats—so much so that sometimes it won't listen to its Trainer's commands.
ZKN_VIOLET_0812_000	When one Rillaboom challenges another who leads a troop, a drumming battle commences. The victor becomes the troop's new boss.
ZKN_VIOLET_0812_999	
ZKN_VIOLET_0813_000	Fire energy gathers in the pads of its feet, raising their temperature. Once hot, Scorbunny's footpads can deal heavy damage to opponents.
ZKN_VIOLET_0814_000	While it prides itself on its varied kicking moves, it can also deliver powerful headbutts once its flames have heated up its forehead.
ZKN_VIOLET_0815_000	Using a ball that it made out of flames, Cinderace blinds its opponents and keeps them at bay.
ZKN_VIOLET_0815_999	
ZKN_VIOLET_0816_000	It's a very cautious Pokémon. When it has no choice but to battle, it hides itself before attacking.
ZKN_VIOLET_0817_000	Highly intelligent but also very lazy, it defends its home by laying traps.
ZKN_VIOLET_0818_000	It may present itself as being well-mannered, but deep down, it still has a lazy side. It will slack off when its Trainer isn't looking.
ZKN_VIOLET_0818_999	
ZKN_VIOLET_0819_000	No matter how much it stuffs its belly with food, it is always anxious about getting hungry again. So, it stashes berries in its cheeks and tail.
ZKN_VIOLET_0820_000	This Pokémon makes off with heaps of fallen berries by wrapping them in its tail, which is roughly twice the length of its body.
ZKN_VIOLET_0821_000	The females are fussier than the males. If another creature dirties a female Rookidee's wings, it'll peck the offender relentlessly in a burning rage.
ZKN_VIOLET_0822_000	This intelligent Pokémon will quickly learn how to use any tool it can hold in its beak or its talons.
ZKN_VIOLET_0823_000	Although its wings have partly turned to steel and become heavy as a result, this Pokémon flies through the skies with ease.

ZKN_VIOLET_0835_000	
ZKN_VIOLET_0836_000	
ZKN_VIOLET_0837_000	Chunks of the surface of this Pokémon's body that have grown old and flaked off have long been used for fuel as an alternative to coal.
ZKN_VIOLET_0838_000	Due to the coal tar created inside it, the heap of coal on Carkol's back never falls apart, even when the Pokémon rolls around at high speeds.
ZKN_VIOLET_0839_000	It's gentle usually but fearsome when angered. With a body that burns at over 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, it crushes foes and turns them to ash.
ZKN_VIOLET_0839_999	
ZKN_VIOLET_0840_000	Applin lives inside an apple. When an Applin is separated from its apple, its body loses moisture and the Pokémon grows weak.
ZKN_VIOLET_0841_000	It uses its own body fluid to repair its apple. Strong Flapple that have won many battles have apples that are clay colored all over.
ZKN_VIOLET_0841_999	
ZKN_VIOLET_0842_000	When some Lechonk come along to lick the sweet nectar on Appletun's back, Appletun will spew sticky nectar at them to drive them away.
ZKN_VIOLET_0842_999	
ZKN_VIOLET_0843_000	Silicobra's large nostrils are specialized for spraying sand, so this Pokémon is not very good at telling apart different smells.
ZKN_VIOLET_0844_000	The sand it spews contains sharp, pointy gravel, which is actually just sand that Sandaconda's saliva has hardened into irregular shapes.
ZKN_VIOLET_0844_999	
ZKN_VIOLET_0845_000	It's an incredibly poor learner because it uses the bare minimum amount of energy for its brain. It focuses on battling instead.
ZKN_VIOLET_0845_001	Cramorant takes advantage of Arrokuda's frantic thrashing to help spit Arrokuda out at high speed.
ZKN_VIOLET_0845_002	With a Pikachu stuck in its throat, Cramorant can use Pikachu's prickling electricity to give its opponents a shock.
ZKN_VIOLET_0846_000	It takes down prey by charging into them with its hard, pointed jaw. But Arrokuda's eyesight is poor, so this tactic has a low success rate.
ZKN_VIOLET_0847_000	It swims at speeds of over 100 knots and battles fiercely with pods of Finizen over prey.
ZKN_VIOLET_0848_000	This selfish, attention-seeking Pokémon stores poison and electricity in two different sacs inside its body.
ZKN_VIOLET_0849_000	The jolts of electricity it launches by violently strumming the protrusions on its chest easily exceed 15,000 volts.
ZKN_VIOLET_0849_001	As it gulps down stagnant water and generates electricity in its body, a sound like a rhythm played by a bass guitar reverberates all around.

ZKN_VIOLET_0854_000	Sinistea gets into your body when you drink it, and then it steals your vitality from within. It also tastes awful.
ZKN_VIOLET_0854_001	This Sinistea lives in an antique teacup. As valuable as this Pokémon is, its awful taste remains unchanged.
ZKN_VIOLET_0855_000	These Pokémon multiply by creeping into teapots and pouring themselves into leftover tea.
ZKN_VIOLET_0855_001	Though risky to drink, this Pokémon's tea tastes delicious. Gourmets who have no fear of danger drink Polteageist tea day after day.
ZKN_VIOLET_0856_000	It senses the feelings of other living creatures. Be careful not to expose it to strong emotions for too long, or it will end up exhausted.
ZKN_VIOLET_0857_000	The moment this Pokémon finds someone who's emitting strong emotions, it will pummel them senseless with its braids to silence them.
ZKN_VIOLET_0858_000	Beware of forests that show no signs of living creatures within. You may have wandered into Hatterene's territory.

ZKN_VIOLET_0859_000	They live in groups, pestering and playing pranks on each other to polish their troublemaking skills.
ZKN_VIOLET_0860_000	This Pokémon absorbs negative emotions and turns them into energy. It's popular with people who tend to think gloomy thoughts.
ZKN_VIOLET_0861_000	It lives deep within the forest. Even after evolving into this splendid form, it hasn't given up on its petty misdeeds and pranks.

ZKN_VIOLET_0867_000	
ZKN_VIOLET_0868_000	When attacked, it tackles its foe and covers them in cream. With its foe either blinded or astonished by deliciousness, Milcery flees.
ZKN_VIOLET_0869_000	Alcremie that have been cherished produce exquisite cream, so Trainers always raise them lovingly.

ZKN_VIOLET_0869_999	
ZKN_VIOLET_0870_000	The leader, known as the brass, uses its extendible horn to issue orders to the others when it's time to change formation.
ZKN_VIOLET_0871_000	This Pokémon is so timid that even brushing against seaweed will make it discharge electricity in surprise. Its lips do not conduct electricity.
ZKN_VIOLET_0872_000	Within its internal organs, Snom amplifies the frigid air it gets from eating snow and then uses this amplified air to create icicle-like spikes.
ZKN_VIOLET_0873_000	It causes blizzards as it flies around with its huge, chill-emanating wings. Clean meltwater is its favorite thing to drink.

ZKN_VIOLET_0875_000	If you lick the ice covering its face, you'll find it has a faintly salty taste. This species rode here on ocean currents from a cold, faraway land.
ZKN_VIOLET_0875_001	Contrary to its looks, Eiscue is a poor swimmer. It creates ice balls at the tip of its single hair to lure prey in and fish them up.
ZKN_VIOLET_0876_000	This Pokémon never leaves its Trainer's side. It predicts their actions with its psychic power and takes care of their day-to-day needs.
ZKN_VIOLET_0876_001	In search of happy feelings—such as joy and gratitude—Indeedee bustles around, taking diligent care of people and other Pokémon.
ZKN_VIOLET_0877_000	It has a small stomach. If it isn't constantly eating the seeds it keeps in its pockets, it will get hungry immediately.
ZKN_VIOLET_0877_001	Hunger has disrupted this Pokémon's hormonal balance. The Electric-type energy stored in its cheek sacs has turned into Dark-type energy.

ZKN_VIOLET_0882_000	
ZKN_VIOLET_0883_000

ZKN_VIOLET_0884_999	
ZKN_VIOLET_0885_000	It has a habit of biting at Clauncher even though it doesn't feed on them. This is said to be vestigial behavior from when Dreepy was alive.

ZKN_VIOLET_0898_002	
ZKN_VIOLET_0902_000	It can jump with incredible power. Parts of its body are tinged red by the rage of its fallen friends.
ZKN_VIOLET_0902_001	It can afflict a target with terrifying illusions that are under its control. The deeper the sadness in its friends' souls, the paler Basculegion becomes.
ZKN_VIOLET_0906_000	The sweet scent its body gives off mesmerizes those around it. The scent grows stronger when this Pokémon is in the sun.
ZKN_VIOLET_0907_000	The hardness of Floragato's fur depends on the Pokémon's mood. When Floragato is prepared to battle, its fur becomes pointed and needle sharp.
ZKN_VIOLET_0908_000	With skillful misdirection, it rigs foes with pollen- packed flower bombs. Meowscarada sets off the bombs before its foes realize what's going on.
ZKN_VIOLET_0909_000	Its flame sac is small, so energy is always leaking out. This energy is released from the dent atop Fuecoco's head and flickers to and fro.
ZKN_VIOLET_0910_000	The valve in Crocalor's flame sac is closely connected to its vocal cords. This Pokémon utters a guttural cry as it spews flames every which way.
ZKN_VIOLET_0911_000	Skeledirge's gentle singing soothes the souls of all that hear it. It burns its enemies to a crisp with flames of over 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit.

ZKN_VIOLET_0914_000	Dancing in ways that evoke far-away places, this Pokémon mesmerizes all that see it. Flourishes of its decorative water feathers slice into its foes.

ZKN_VIOLET_0916_000	It entrances female Pokémon with the sweet, alluring scent that wafts from all over its body.
ZKN_VIOLET_0916_001	This is a meticulous Pokémon that likes to keep things tidy. It shrouds itself in a floral aroma that soothes the Pokémon around it.
ZKN_VIOLET_0917_000	The thread it secretes from its rear is as strong as wire. The secret behind the thread's strength is the topic of ongoing research.
ZKN_VIOLET_0918_000	Spidops covers its territory in tough, sticky threads to set up traps for intruders.
ZKN_VIOLET_0919_000	It's highly skilled at a fighting style in which it uses its jumping capabilities to dodge incoming attacks while also dealing damage to opponents.
ZKN_VIOLET_0920_000	It uses its normally folded third set of legs when in Showdown Mode. This places a huge burden on its body, so it can't stay in this mode for long.
ZKN_VIOLET_0921_000	The pads of its paws are electricity-discharging organs. Pawmi fires electricity from its forepaws while standing unsteadily on its hind legs.
ZKN_VIOLET_0922_000	Pawmo uses a unique fighting technique in which it uses its forepaws to strike foes and zap them with electricity from its paw pads simultaneously.
ZKN_VIOLET_0923_000	Pawmot's fluffy fur acts as a battery. It can store the same amount of electricity as an electric car.
ZKN_VIOLET_0924_000	The pair sticks together no matter what. They split any food they find exactly in half and then eat it together.
ZKN_VIOLET_0925_000	The little one just appeared one day. They all live together like a family, but the relationship between the three is still unclear.
ZKN_VIOLET_0925_001	The larger pair protects the little ones during battles. When facing strong opponents, the whole group will join the fight.
ZKN_VIOLET_0926_000	The yeast in Fidough's breath is useful for cooking, so this Pokémon has been protected by people since long ago.
ZKN_VIOLET_0927_000	The surface of this Pokémon's skin hardens when exposed to intense heat, and its body has an appetizing aroma.
ZKN_VIOLET_0928_000	This Pokémon converts nutrients into oil, which it stores in the fruit on its head. It can easily go a whole week without eating or drinking.
ZKN_VIOLET_0929_000	It basks in the sun to its heart's content until the fruits on its head ripen. After that, Dolliv departs from human settlements and goes on a journey.
ZKN_VIOLET_0930_000	This Pokémon drives back enemies by launching its rich, aromatic oil at them with enough force to smash a boulder.
ZKN_VIOLET_0931_000	Green-feathered flocks hold the most sway. When they're out searching for food in the mornings and evenings, it gets very noisy.
ZKN_VIOLET_0931_001	Blue-feathered Squawkabilly view their green- feathered counterparts as rivals, since the latter make up the largest, most powerful groups.
ZKN_VIOLET_0931_002	The yellow Squawkabilly are especially fierce. They've even been known to drive other bird Pokémon out of town.
ZKN_VIOLET_0931_003	Though these Squawkabilly are the fewest in number, they have no trouble living in towns since they blend in with the white buildings.
ZKN_VIOLET_0932_000	The ground scrapes its body as it travels, causing it to leave salt behind. Salt is constantly being created and replenished inside Nacli's body.
ZKN_VIOLET_0933_000	It compresses rock salt inside its body and shoots out hardened salt pellets with enough force to perforate an iron sheet.
ZKN_VIOLET_0934_000	Many Pokémon gather around Garganacl, hoping to lick at its mineral-rich salt.
ZKN_VIOLET_0935_000	Its firepower increases when it fights, reaching over 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. It likes berries that are rich in fat.
ZKN_VIOLET_0936_000	This Pokémon clads itself in armor that has been fortified by psychic and fire energy, and it shoots blazing fireballs.
ZKN_VIOLET_0937_000	An old set of armor steeped in grudges caused this Pokémon's evolution. Ceruledge cuts its enemies to pieces without mercy.
ZKN_VIOLET_0938_000	It floats using the electricity stored in its body. When thunderclouds are around, Tadbulb will float higher off the ground.
ZKN_VIOLET_0939_000	What appear to be eyeballs are actually organs for discharging the electricity generated by Bellibolt's belly-button dynamo.
ZKN_VIOLET_0940_000	These Pokémon make their nests on coastal cliffs. The nests have a strange, crackling texture, and they're a popular delicacy.
ZKN_VIOLET_0941_000	It uses its throat sac to store electricity generated by its wings. There's hardly any oil in its feathers, so it is a poor swimmer.
ZKN_VIOLET_0942_000	Its well-developed jaw and fangs are strong enough to crunch through boulders, and its thick fat makes for an excellent defense.
ZKN_VIOLET_0943_000	Mabosstiff loves playing with children. Though usually gentle, it takes on an intimidating look when protecting its family.
ZKN_VIOLET_0944_000	To keep enemies away from its territory, it paints markings around its nest using a poisonous liquid that has an acrid odor.
ZKN_VIOLET_0945_000	Each Grafaiai paints its own individual pattern, and it will paint that same pattern over and over again throughout its life.
ZKN_VIOLET_0946_000	Not even Bramblin knows where it is headed as it tumbles across the wilderness, blown by the wind. It loathes getting wet.
ZKN_VIOLET_0947_000	Brambleghast wanders around arid regions. On rare occasions, mass outbreaks of these Pokémon will bury an entire town.
ZKN_VIOLET_0948_000	Though it looks like Tentacool, Toedscool is a completely different species. Its legs may be thin, but it can run at a speed of 30 mph.
ZKN_VIOLET_0949_000	It coils its 10 tentacles around prey and sucks out their nutrients, causing the prey pain. The folds along the rim of its head are a popular delicacy.
ZKN_VIOLET_0950_000	This Pokémon lives on sheer cliffs. It sidesteps opponents' attacks, then lunges for their weak spots with its claws.
ZKN_VIOLET_0951_000	Traditional Paldean dishes can be extremely spicy because they include the shed front teeth of Capsakid among their ingredients.
ZKN_VIOLET_0952_000	The green head has turned vicious due to the spicy chemicals stimulating its brain. Once it goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it.
ZKN_VIOLET_0953_000	It rolls its mud ball around while the energy it needs for evolution matures. Eventually the time comes for it to evolve.
ZKN_VIOLET_0954_000	An infant sleeps inside the ball. Rabsca rolls the ball soothingly with its legs to ensure the infant sleeps comfortably.
ZKN_VIOLET_0955_000	It spends its time running around wastelands. If anyone steals its beloved berries, it will chase them down and exact its revenge.
ZKN_VIOLET_0956_000	It emits psychic power from the gaps between its multicolored frills and sprints at speeds greater than 120 mph.
ZKN_VIOLET_0957_000	This Pokémon pounds iron scraps together to make a hammer. It will remake the hammer again and again until it's satisfied with the result.
ZKN_VIOLET_0958_000	These Pokémon make their homes in piles of scrap metal. They test the strength of each other's hammers by smashing them together.
ZKN_VIOLET_0959_000	The hammer tops 220 pounds, yet it gets swung around easily by Tinkaton as it steals whatever it pleases and carries its plunder back home.
ZKN_VIOLET_0960_000	Though it looks like Diglett, Wiglett is an entirely different species. The resemblance seems to be a coincidental result of environmental adaptation.
ZKN_VIOLET_0961_000	A variety of fish Pokémon, Wugtrio was once considered to be a regional form of Dugtrio.
ZKN_VIOLET_0962_000	Bombirdier uses the apron on its chest to bundle up food, which it carries back to its nest. It enjoys dropping things that make loud noises.
ZKN_VIOLET_0963_000	Its water ring is made from seawater mixed with a sticky fluid that Finizen secretes from its blowhole.
ZKN_VIOLET_0964_000	Its physical capabilities are no different than a Finizen's, but when its allies are in danger, it transforms and powers itself up.
ZKN_VIOLET_0964_001	This hero of the ocean swims at a speed of 50 knots and saves drowning people and Pokémon.
ZKN_VIOLET_0965_000	The steel section is Varoom's actual body. This Pokémon clings to rocks and converts the minerals within into energy to fuel its activities.
ZKN_VIOLET_0966_000	Revavroom viciously threatens others with the sound of its exhaust. It sticks its tongue out from its cylindrical mouth and sprays toxic fluids.
ZKN_VIOLET_0967_000	It can sprint at over 70 mph while carrying a human. The rider's body heat warms Cyclizar's back and lifts the Pokémon's spirit.
ZKN_VIOLET_0968_000	This Pokémon lives in arid deserts. It maintains its metal body by consuming iron from the soil.
ZKN_VIOLET_0969_000	Glimmet's toxic mineral crystals look just like flower petals. This Pokémon scatters poisonous powder like pollen to protect itself.
